number of cluster headaches and the means of treating (medication) of these attacks. Subjects will then be randomized to into either two groups. The first group is continuing with standard of care and the second group is treatment with the investigational device (GammaCore) for a period of 4 weeks. After this 4 week period, all subjects will treat with the GammaCore for another 4 week period. It is hypothesized the the treatment group will have a reduction in mean cluster headaches per week by 50% compared to the standard of care group."],"detailedDescription":["The study is a prospective randomized controlled multi-center investigation designed for comparison of two parallel groups, GammaCore® (active treatment) and Standard of Care, SoC, (control). The study period begins with a 2 week run-in period, followed by a 4 week comparative period when the subjects are randomized to either active treatment or control 1:1. The comparative period will be followed by a period where all subject will receive GammaCore® for 4 weeks.After the subject signed the Consent Form for participation the baseline (visit1) data will be collected. Subject will be informed how to complete the 2 week diary during the run-in period During the run-in period, all subjects will use stable SoC according to their individual prescriptions. The subject will record as CH attack regarding duration and frequency and the use of medication and oxygen.\n\nOnce subjects have finalized the run-in period, they are randomized to continue in 4 weeks comparative period. During this period, the control group continues with stable SoC and the active group is provided with a GammaCore® device for prophylactic and acute treatment in addition to the stable SoC Subjects stimulate 3 x 2 times daily as part of the prophylactic treatment regimen (cervical vagal nerve). Three 90 second stimulations are self-administered by the subject with 5 minutes between each stimulation on the right side of the neck.\n\nThis preventive stimulation regimen is performed:\n\n* First Daily Treatment - within 1 hour of waking\n* Second Daily Treatment - 7-10 hours following the first daily treatment\n\nAcute CH attack:\n\n* 3 x 90 second treatments consecutively at the onset of pain or symptoms. If the attack is not aborted within 15 minutes the subject should be informed to take SOC abortive medication.\n* If an acute cluster headache attack is treated with the GammaCore® device, the subject will try to work within the preventive treatment window to avoid a preventive treatment in the 2-hour refractory period following the acute treatment.\n\nA total of minimally 6 stimulations for the preventive part and as needed for the acute attacks. The active group also continues with the stable SoC during the entire 4 weeks period. Both groups record all CH attacks in the diary together with medication and oxygen use. All adverse events shall also be recorded in the diary.\n\nThe end of the 4 week comparative period marks the completion of the randomized part of the study, however all subjects are provided the option to continue to a 4 week GammaCore® treatment with the same stimulation parameter as during the 4 week randomization period. All subjects randomized to the SoC group will receive training.\n\nDuring the entire study period, subjects are allowed to take rescue medication including oxygen inhalation for abortion of CH attacks. The amount and doses of the medication and oxygen are recorded in the diary."]},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":[["Chronic Cluster Headache"]],"keywords":[["vagus nerve stimulation"],["vagal nerve stimulation"],["nVNS"],["VNS"],["cluster headache"],["chronic"],["non invasive"],["gammacore"]]},"designModule":{"studyType":["INTERVENTIONAL"],"phases":[["PHASE2"]],"designInfo":{"allocation":["RANDOMIZED"],"interventionModel":["PARALLEL"],"primaryPurpose":["TREATMENT"],"maskingInfo":{"masking":["NONE"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":[97],"type":["ACTUAL"]}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":["Standard of care"],"type":["NO_INTERVENTION"],"description":["No intervention, standard of care"]},{"label":["GammaCore"],"type":["ACTIVE_COMPARATOR"],"description":["Three stimulation treatments 2x/day 7 to 10 hours apart from one another.

Patients who are currently in a cluster cycle will be treated with 2 consecutive days of IV Depacon followed by oral Depakote ER. Patients will receive a total of 1,000mg of Depacon and 1,000mg of Depakote ER each day. Patients may have a 3rd day of IV Depacon followed by oral Depakote ER if the primary investigator believes it to be beneficial. The patient is then sent home on oral Depakote ER. The dose of Depakote ER can range from 500mg to 2,000mg this dose is to be determined by the primary investigator. The patient will continue the oral Depakote ER until the end of their cluster cycle or for a maximum of 6 weeks, which ever comes first."],"detailedDescription":["This study will consist of four visits (3 visits if the screening visit and first treatment visit are on the same day).\n\nScreening Visit:\n\nThe screening visit can be performed either before an active cluster period or once the cluster period has already started. If the subject agrees to participate, the study doctor will determine if they are eligible for this study. The subject will be asked about their headache history, and medical history including all medications they are currently taking. A brief physical examination and neurologic examination will be performed and vital signs (pulse and blood pressure) will be measured. If the subject is a woman who is capable of bearing children, they will be asked to provide a urine sample for a routine pregnancy test. A blood sample (approximately 2 teaspoons) will also be obtained. Blood samples will be taken for a liver function test (LFT), complete blood count (CBC) with differential, chemistry profile, prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT).If the screening visit is the same day as the first treatment visit, this blood work will be sent for immediate analysis. The results must be reviewed and approved by the study physician prior to the subject being administered study medication.\n\nTreatment Visit One:\n\nIf the subject does not undergo treatment at the screening visit because they are not in an active cluster period, the subject will be asked to contact the site once their next cluster period begins. Subjects will be scheduled to come for their first treatment visit as soon as possible.\n\nIf the screening visit is not the same day as the first treatment visit, the study physician and or delegated research staff will re-explain the informed consent, ask the subject to re-read the informed consent and verbally re-confirm their agreement to participate in this trial.\n\nThe research staff will then determine whether the subject continues to qualify for the research trial. They will ask the subject about any changes in their medications since their last visit and/or any changes in their medical conditions since their last visit. Vital signs will be measured and if the subject is a woman of childbearing potential a urine sample will be obtained for routine pregnancy testing. A brief physical examination and neurologic examination will be performed by the study physician. The subject will be given a diary to take home with instructions on how to complete it. The subject will be scheduled to return to the study office the next day.\n\nOnce all of the above procedures have been completed, the research staff will then ask the subject to lie down in an exam room. They research nurse or study physician will then administer one of the study medications (Depacon) through an IV placed in their arm. Subjects will receive 1000mg of Depacon IV. This medication will be infused (administered) over a five minute period. The subjects' vital signs will be measured at 3 minutes, 5 minutes and 15 minutes after the medication has been completely administered.\n\nThe subject will remain in the study office for one hour for observation. Subjects will be closely monitored and repeatedly queried for the development of adverse events. Appropriate intervention and follow-up will be applied as deemed necessary by the investigator.\n\nPrior to leaving the office, the research nurse or study physician will give the subject an oral dose of the second study medication, 1000mg of Depakote ER.\n\nTreatment Visit Two:\n\nThe subject will return to the study office the next day for their second treatment visit. The study staff will review the subject's diary and record their vital signs. The subject's take home diary will be re-dispensed. The subject will then undergo the same infusion procedure as in their first treatment visit. Subjects will again receive a total of 1000mg of Depacon IV. Subjects will be closely monitored and repeatedly queried for the development of adverse events. Appropriate intervention and follow-up will be applied as deemed necessary by the investigator.\n\nPrior to leaving the office, the research nurse or study physician will give the subject an oral dose of the second study medication, 1000mg of Depakote ER.\n\nThe subject may or may not be asked to return the next day for a third treatment day depending on the study physicians' review of their response to study treatment. If it is determined that the subject does not need to return for a third treatment day, a blood sample will be obtained from a vein in their arm. The subject will also be given a take home supply of the oral study drug Depakote ER with instructions. The subject will be scheduled to return to the study office in 6 weeks OR when their current cluster cycle ends, whichever comes first.\n\nThe research staff will contact the subject bi-weekly to see how they are doing and to confirm that they are taking your study drug appropriately. The research staff will also ask the subject if they have had any unwanted experiences since their last contact with the site. The subject will be instructed to call the study site should they have any questions or have any unwanted experiences.\n\nTreatment Visit Three:\n\nIf the study physician determines that the subject should return for a third treatment day, the subject will return to the study office the day after their second treatment visit. The same infusion procedures will be performed. The study staff will review the subject's diary and record their vital signs. A blood sample (2 teaspoons) will be obtained from a vein in their arm. Prior to leaving the office, the research nurse or study physician will give the subject an oral dose of the second study medication, Depakote ER.\n\nThe subject will be given a take home supply of the oral study drug Depakote ER with instructions. Subjects will be instructed to take 2000mg of Depakote ER once a day. The subject will be scheduled to return to the study office in 6 weeks OR when their current cluster cycle ends, whichever comes first. The research staff will contact the subject bi-weekly to see how they are doing and to confirm that they are taking your study drug appropriately. The research staff will also ask whether or not the subject had any unusual symptoms, or out of the ordinary experiences since their last contact with the site. The subject will be instructed to call the study site should they have any questions or have any unwanted experiences.\n\nFinal Visit:\n\nThe final visit to the study office will occur either 6 weeks after the subjects last treatment visit OR when the subjects current cluster cycle ends, whichever comes first. At this visit, the study staff will collect and review the subject's diary as well as any unused study medication. The subject will be asked about any changes in medications and/ or medical conditions since their last contact with the site. The subject will also be asked about any unusual symptoms, or out of the ordinary experiences since their last contact with the site. The subject will be asked to report how they felt they responded to the study medication. The subject's vital signs will be measured and a blood sample (2 teaspoons) will be obtained from a vein in their arm."]},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":[["Cluster Headache"]]},"designModule":{"studyType":["INTERVENTIONAL"],"phases":[["NA"]],"designInfo":{"allocation":["NON_RANDOMIZED"],"interventionModel":["SINGLE_GROUP"],"primaryPurpose":["TREATMENT"],"maskingInfo":{"masking":["NONE"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":[15],"type":["ACTUAL"]}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":["Depacon IV and Depakote ER"],"type":["EXPERIMENTAL"],"description":["Subjects will be treated in this single arm study with 2 consecutive days of IV Depacon followed by oral Depakote ER for a total of 1000 mg of Depacon and 1000 mg of Depakote ER each day."],"interventionNames":[["Drug: Depacon IV and Depakote ER"]]}],"interventions":[{"type":["DRUG"],"name":["Depacon IV and Depakote ER"],"armGroupLabels":[["Depacon IV and Depakote ER"]]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":["Time Required to Achieve a Greater Than or Equal to 50% Reduction in Frequency or Severity of Individual Cluster Attacks Compared to Subject-reported Baseline."],"description":["Severity: measured on an 11 point scale, where 0 = no pain and 10= excruciating pain.
