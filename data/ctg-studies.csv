NCT06540651,Efficacy of Light Therapy in Treatment of Chronic Cluster Headache,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06540651,LUMIAVFc,RECRUITING,"Cluster headache is a primary headache. The chronic form of the disease is often difficult to treat. It is now considered a chronobiological disease. This chronobiological character is based on clinical, biological and radiological arguments.

This study focuses on the use of light therapy in cluster headache. Light therapy has already been used in the treatment of other chronobiological diseases, such as seasonal depression, but also recently in the therapy of other primary headaches (such as migraine). Its aim is to re-adjust chronobiological rhythms, and it therefore seems worth testing in the chronic form of cluster headache.

NCT06503328,Role of Specific microRNAs in Cluster Headache,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06503328,5*1000,RECRUITING,"Cluster headache (CH) is a primary headache included in the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TACs) according to the International Calssification of Headache Disorder, Third Edition. CH is characterized by a multifaceted and incompletely understood pathophysiology. Recent experimental evidence has increasingly emphasized the role of specific microRNAs (miRNAs) in the pathophysiology of primary headaches, including migraine.

In a recent study, we observed an upregulation in the gene expression of two miRNAs, miR-382-5p and miR-34a-5p, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of subjects with chronic migraine (CM). These miRNAs are involved in inflammation modulation and the release of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Notably, this upregulation correlated with the migraine phenotype and its severity.

Several neuropeptides have been established to play an active role in CH. Studies by the Danish group have demonstrated that intravenous administration of CGRP, PACAP, or VIP can induce CH attacks in at least 50% of participants in the active phase of the disease.

Objective: To investigate the effects of an oral LSD pulse regimen (3 x 100 µg LSD in three weeks) in patients suffering from CH compared with placebo.

Design: Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled two-phase cross-over study design.

Participants: 30 patients aged ≥ 25 and ≤ 75 years with chronic or episodic CH with predictable periods lasting approximately 2 months and attacks responding to oxygen.

Main outcome measures: Changes in frequency and intensity of CH attacks assessed with a standardized headache diary Significance: CH is often rated as the most painful of all primary headaches, which not only causes significant disability, but is also associated with enormous personal, economic, and psychiatric burden. At the moment, there is no specific treatment available for CH, but serotonergic compounds represent an important drug class, especially in the abortive management of cluster attacks.

NCT02466334,CGRP's Cluster Headache Inducing Abilities in Cluster Headache Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02466334,,COMPLETED,"It has previously been shown that nitroglycerine induces cluster headache attacks in episodic cluster headache patients (ECH patients) in bouts but not in remission phase. Furthermore, plasma concentrations of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) have been shown to be significantly higher during, but not before and after, an attack.

The attack appears around 20-40 min after nitroglycerine infusion with vasodilatation. During this latency period preceding the attack, no increase in CGRP plasma concentrations is seen. CGRP induces migraine attacks in 65% of migraine patients, and CGRP antagonists as well as monoclonal antibodies against CGRP are effective in migraine treatment.

Based on the above the investigators hypothesize the following:

1. Provoking ECH patients in bout with CGRP triggers cluster headache attacks

A parasympathetic dysfunction in CH has been suggested. The sphenopalatine ganglion has been a target for treatment of primary headache disorders for more than a century but there are several anatomic and physiologic studies that suggest that another cranial parasympathetic ganglion, the otic ganglion (OG), might be also relevant in CH. In this study OG will be blocked with botulinum toxin type A in a pilot study in 10 patients with chronic cluster headache. Recruitment of patients will be solely in Norway. There is no data available to determine the correct dosage of botulinum toxin. A similar neural structure that has been blocked with botulinum toxin in humans is the sphenopalatine ganglion. The investigators injected 10 patients suffering from intractable chronic cluster headache with botulinum toxin in the sphenopalatine ganglion. 5 patients were given 25 IU and 5 patients were given 50 IU. Even though the number of treated patients is low, there did not appear to be differences in the adverse events profile between those who received 25 Iu and those who received 50 IU. The investigators also previously injected 25 IU botulinum toxin towards the sphenopalatine ganglion bilaterally (i.e. 25 IU in each side) in 10 patients suffering from intractable chronic migraine. Doses of up to 25 IU have been injected in structures adjacent to the otic ganglion, for instance in dystonia towards the lateral pterygoid muscle.

The headache is believed to be the most intense of all headaches and among many is totally disabling and of great personal and social consequences. For a small group of patients with episodic and most chronic form, drug therapy has little effect. For them, surgery can be a solution.

Neuroradiology has found evidence of a possible original activation of cluster headache from the portion of the brain called hypothalamus. Furthermore, an activation of the parasympathetic nervous system through the sphenopalatine ganglion, which may also explain some of the one-sided involuntary symptoms, is suspected in cluster headache. Injection of Botulinum toxin type A (BTA) inhibits secretion of synaptic acetylcholine resulting in nerve signals being blocked. The duration of such a blockade is believed to be 3-9 months.

NCT05857098,Detection of Local Field Potentials in the Ventral Tegmental Area of the Midbrain in Chronic Cluster Headache Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05857098,DETECT,UNKNOWN,"The physiopathology of trigeminal-autonomic cephalalgia, and more particularly of cluster headache (CH) is still partially unknown. Three main structures are involved: the trigeminovascular system, the cephalic afferents of the autonomic nervous system, and centrally the hypothalamus. There are many clinical arguments in favor of the involvement of the hypothalamus in CH. In addition, several radiological studies have confirmed the involvement of the posterior hypothalamic region in cluster attacks. Thus, a positron emission tomography study showed hyperactivity of the posteroinferior nucleus of the ipsilateral hypothalamus. Voxel based MRI studies have shown a bilateral increase in the volume of the inferoposterior part of the homolateral hypothalamus. The involvement of the posterior hypothalamic region or more precisely the ventral tegmental area of the midbrain therefore seems acquired, although its real role as a generator or modulator of pain remains to be precised.

Deep brain stimulation (dBS) is used in the management of chronic drug-resistant CH with an overall efficacy in 2/3 of patients. Nevertheless, its mechanism of action remains poorly understood, thus limiting the selection of patients and the optimization of care. The lack of clear neurophysiological criteria to identify the neuronal population to be targeted is a major source of uncertainty in the positioning of dBS electrodes and parameters adjustment. In order to improve the understanding and at the same time the results of this technique, obtaining in vivo electrophysiological data seems mandatory. Local fields potentials (LFP) have been recordered by in vivo by dBS in other diseases (Parkinson's disease, tremor…) and their analysis has brought new insigights in the characterization and understanding of these pathology. New generations of neurostimulator (Percept Medtronic) enables continuous recording of LFP in implanted patients. The goal of our study is the recording of LFP at the time of CH attacks via the BrainSenseTM system. This system included in the stimulator allows in vivo collection of LFP in the absence and presence of stimulation. The pathophysiological data recordered will then be correlated with the clinical benefit of the dBS ( nulber of attacks, duration, pain intensity…).

NCT06882278,Pulsed Radiofrequency Combined With Platelet-Rich Plasma Applied to the Sphenopalatine Ganglion in Treating Episodic Cluster Headache,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06882278,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Cluster headache (CH) is one of the most severe pain accompanied by ipsilateral autonomic symptoms such as lacrimation and conjunctival injection. CH can be categorized into episodic cluster headache (ECH), chronic cluster headache (CCH), and probable CH. Intervention for CH requires a multifaceted and early approach and varies due to the heterogeneity of patients, which makes it difficult to formulate appropriate treatment plan, and the minimally invasive interventional therapy between drug and surgical treatment is still worth looking forward to.

The pterygopalatine ganglion, also known as SPG, is a essential proportion in activation of cortical structures and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of CH attacks, which makes it the potential therapeutic target in drug-resistant CH. Percutaneous pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) at SPG is a minimally destructive treatment which shows efficacy, safety, and repeatedly efficacy for refractory CH. PRF is a reliable alternative with few neurological side effects and complications for patients who have not responded to conservative treatment. However, the long term pain relieve is not satisfying. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is an autologous blood-derived product of 3 times concentrated platelet above average levels, which contains many growth factors, cytokines, chemokine, and cell-adhesion molecules, therefore function in the activation and synthesis of healing process, tissue proliferation and regeneration. Researches by Michno etc. and Giaccari etc. have proved that PRP combined with PRF therapy may provide more effective outcome than PRF alone in treatment of neuralgia, but whether the combined therapy can improve the efficacy of CH treatment is not clear. ECH occurs in 90% of the CH patients. The investigators assume that PRP combined with PRF acting on SPG might have better therapeutic effect on ECH than PRF alone, by giving combined treatment or PRF therapy alone according to patients willingness, the investigators plan on conducting this prospective trail to compare the clinical efficacy and safety of PRP combined with PRF versus PRF alone.",NO,Cluster Headache|Pain Management|Episodic Cluster Headache,,"change in the weekly frequency of cluster headache attacks, The overall mean change from baseline in the weekly frequency of cluster headache attacks across weeks 1 through 3, At 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks after the operation","change in the weekly frequency of cluster headache attacks, the overall mean change from baseline in the weekly frequency of cluster headache attacks, At 1day, 3days, 1week, 2weeks, 1month, 3months, 6months and 1year after the operation|the percentage of patients with a reduction of at least 50% in the weekly frequency of cluster headache attacks, the percentage of patients with a reduction from baseline of at least 50% in the weekly frequency of cluster headache attacks, At 1day, 3days, 1week, 2weeks, 1month, 3months, 6months and 1year after the operation.|the degree of pain, the degree of pain during headache attacks (NRS scores), At 1day, 3days, 1week, 2weeks, 1month, 3months, 6months and 1year after the operation.|the duration of each headache attack, the duration of each headache attack, At 1day, 3days, 1week, 2weeks, 3 weeks, 1month, 3months, 6months and 1year after the procedure.|dose of auxiliary analgesic drugs, the dose of auxiliary analgesic drugs taken, At 1day, 3days, 1week, 2weeks, 3 weeks, 1month, 3months, 6months and 1year after the procedure.|self-rated patient satisfaction, the self-rated patient satisfaction, from 0 point for unsatisfied to 10 points for very satisfied., At 1day, 3days, 1week, 2weeks, 3 weeks, 1month, 3months, 6months and 1year after the procedure.|WHOQOL-BREF, the degree of patient satisfaction measured by WHOQOL-BREF (World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire)., At 1day, 3days, 1week, 2weeks, 3 weeks, 1month, 3months, 6months and 1year after the procedure.|adverse events, For intraoperative AEs, the occurrence of puncture pain, headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, facial haematoma and other effects will be recorded.

NCT01151631,Occipital Nerve Stimulation in Medically Intractable Chronic Cluster Headache,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01151631,ICON,COMPLETED,"Cluster headache (CH) is a primary headache disorder characterized by recurrent short-lasting attacks (15 to 180 minutes) of excruciating unilateral periorbital pain accompanied by ipsilateral cranial autonomic signs. The 1-year prevalence of CH is about 0.1 %, the male: female ratio is 3:1. The majority of patients have cluster periods of weeks to months with frequent attacks which are alternated with symptom-free periods of months to several years; the episodic from of CH. In about 10% of patients the CH is chronic (CCH) in which either no remission occurs within 1 year or the remissions last less than 1 month. At least 10 % of CCH patients are refractory to medical treatment or cannot tolerate the treatments.

Recent pilot studies suggest that occipital nerve stimulation (ONS) in medically intractable CCH (MICCH) might offer an effective alternative to medical treatment. There are no randomised clinical trials and a placebo effect cannot be excluded. Long term tolerability is known from other indications.

Here the investigators propose a prospective, randomised, double blind, parallel group multi-centre international clinical study to compare the reduction in attack frequency from baseline of occipital nerve stimulation (ONS) in patients with MICCH between two different stimulation conditions: high (100%) and low (30%) stimulation.

Following implantation there will first be a run-in phase of 10 days of 10% stimulation intensity, followed by a stepwise monthly increase up to either 30% or 100%. Patients will be assessed monthly by a blinded assessor. The primary outcome measure is the mean number of attacks over the last 4 weeks of the double blind 6 month treatment period in the 100% versus the 30% treatment group. Hereafter, in an open extension phase of 6 months, all patients will receive 100% stimulation or the stimulation considered optimal by the patient.

Secondary outcome measures include the rate of responders (≥ 50% reduction in attack frequency during the last 4 weeks of each treatment period), patient's satisfaction, medication use, quality of life, mean pain intensity, economic evaluation and whether patients would recommend the treatment to another patient. The investigators will also investigate whether predictive factors can be identified for efficacy.",NO,Chronic Cluster Headache,DEVICE: occipital nerve stimulation,"The mean attack frequency (MAF) over the last 4 weeks in the 100% and the 30% treatment groups, An attack is defined as any attack recognised by the patient as being a CH attack.

NCT03010189,Actigraphy and Nocturnal Heartrate Variability in Cluster Headache Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03010189,,COMPLETED,"Cluster headache is one of the most painful headaches, characterized by recurring episodes of unilateral, periorbital pain, which is accompanied by autonomic symptoms that seem to be of both sympathetic and parasympathetic origin. The pathophysiology behind the condition is largely unknown, but increasing evidence indicate that the hypothalamus plays a pivotal role. The headache attacks come in clusters or bouts (hence the name) which last up to three months, after which the headache disappears for at least one month. 10-15% have chronic cluster headache. During attacks, the patients have cranial sympathetic hypoactivity and parasympathetic hyperactivity, whereas they have cranial parasympathetic hypoactivity during remission phase. There is an emerging hypothesis that headache attacks are elicited in a state of autonomic hypoarousability, which is also supported by the fact that most cluster attacks occur during the night, when the patients are sleeping.

The aim in this project is to study the intercept between the sleep-wake cycle, autonomic tone and the occurrence of headache attacks, by using actigraphy, heart-rate variability and pupillometry. All these methods are well validated, and frequently used in studies on sleep and autonomic function. The study design is that of a case-control model where 15 cluster headache patients will undergo pupillometry, before wearing the actigraph and heart-rate variability-monitor for two weeks, once in cluster bout and once in remission phase. The actigraphy will register nocturnal movement and sleep quality, and headache attacks will be registered by pressing a button on the actigraph. The pupillometry measures pupillary constriction and dilation in response to light, a reflex that is controlled by the autonomic nervous system. The heart-rate variability monitors fluctuations in the heart rate which reflects the sympathovagal balance of cardiac control. All participants will fill out the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index before and after registration. In addition, 15 healthy controls will undergo one session of the same examinations. The results of the study will give valuable insight to the pathophysiology of a condition that is very painful and has great impact on the patients' quality of life, and also add knowledge to the relation between headache, sleep and the autonomic nervous system.",NO,Cluster Headache|Sleep,DEVICE: Actigraphy|DEVICE: Heart-rate variability monitoring|DEVICE: Pupillometry,"Change in pupillary average contraction velocity, The velocity of pupillary constriction in response to light, measured with a pupillometer, in mm/sec, Once in the beginning of a headache phase, and once 4 weeks after last headache attack|Change in total sleep time, Average number of hours asleep per night, measured over two weeks with an actigraph, Measured for two weeks during headache phase, and again four weeks after last headache attack|Change in sleep efficiency, Average number of hours asleep per night divided by time spent in bed, measured over two weeks with an actigraph, Measured for two weeks during headache phase, and again four weeks after last headache attack|Change in wake after sleep onset, Average number of awakenings during the sleep phase, measured over two weeks with an actigraph, Measured for two weeks during headache phase, and again four weeks after last headache attack|Change in LF/HF ratio, The ratio of low-frequency and high-frequency fluctuations in heart rate, measured over two weeks with a heart-rate variability monitor, Measured for two weeks during headache phase, and again four weeks after last headache attack",,,Nordlandssykehuset HF,University of Tromso,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,20,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: BASIC_SCIENCE,2015/1789(REK),2017-01,2018-12,2018-12,2017-01-04,,2019-03-21,"Nordland Hospital Trust, Bodø, Nordland, 8003, Norway",

Study outline

Month 1: Baseline. Establishment of a baseline profile of the participants CH attacks (severity, duration, medicine utilization etc), health-related quality of life (QoL) and symptoms of anxiety and depression. No active treatment. Follow-up visit after 30 days.

Months 2-4: TENS period. All participants will receive TENS-treatment. Clinical follow-up visit by the end of month four.

Months 5-7: Double-blinded, randomized experimental period. All participants will have an ONS-system (lead, impulse generator) implanted and will be randomized 1:1 to receive either 1) burst (paresthesia-free) ONS or 2) placebo (deactivated ONS system). Clinical follow-up visit by the end of month seven.

Months 8-10: Open label period. All participants will receive tonic (conventional, paresthesia-inducing) ONS.

NCT01395264,Saccadometry in Primary Headache Syndromes,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01395264,,TERMINATED,"Migraine is one of the commonest neurological disorders, affecting up to 12% of the general population, but remains relatively under-diagnosed and under-treated. Migraine has a wide socioeconomic impact and brings a large economic burden; estimates suggest that disability due to migraine costs \> €27 billion per annum across Europe. Despite its prevalence and impact, migraine pathophysiology is poorly understood. A wider understanding of the functional changes in this disorder would be beneficial to both diagnosis and treatment.

Saccades are the rapid eye movements we make when moving the eyes to a new object in our visual field. Reaction time studies have been used to investigate Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease with great success. These use saccadic tasks (monitoring eye movements). Even at rest we make approximately three saccades per second, so a lot of data can quickly be gathered with non-invasive testing. We hope to understand more of the underlying mechanisms of migraine by studying reaction time in migraine patients.

Our previous pilot study, with less stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria, looked at fewer patients (32 migraineurs and 32 controls), and found that migraineurs showed significantly different saccadic patterns to non-migraineurs.

This study firstly seeks to corroborate the saccadometric findings of our earlier pilot study in a group of migraineurs, and secondly to explore the specificity of these findings in migraine by also studying patients with another primary headache syndrome, namely cluster headache.

Migraine is known to be a dynamic disorder, with previous studies showing longitudinal changes in the migraine brain. To explore this further we hope to record longitudinally (Every day for 21 days) in a small subset of migraineurs to identify potential longitudinal changes in saccadic reaction time.

Migraine day can also be defined as a headache day that is effective for the acute treatment of specific migraine drugs (triptan, ditan, gepant, ergotamine, etc.)., Medium term: within 6 months after initial diagnosis; long term: 30 years|Moderate / Severe Headache Days, Moderate / severe headache days are defined as a day in which moderate or severe pain persists for at least 4 hours, or headache lasts for one day after successful medication for acute headache. These definitions allow the use of relatively simple headache diaries. Subjects were required to indicate whether headache was present (yes / no), peak (mild / moderate / severe) severity and duration (\< 4h or 4h), type of acute drug intake (triptan ergot / other), and response to treatment should also be recorded., Medium term: within 6 months after initial diagnosis; long term: 30 years|Vertigo attack, Vertigo is a sensation of feeling off balance. Vertigo attack is defined as any vertigo or dizziness attacks, such as the condition where person has the sensation of moving or of surrounding objects moving when they are not. Some questionnaires, such as the dizziness handicap inventory (DHI) and Vertigo Symptom Scale (VSS) are used to assess the severity of vertigo. The differential diagnosis of vertigo or dizziness can be narrowed with easy-to-perform physical examination tests, including evaluation for nystagmus, the Dix Hallpike maneuver, and orthostatic blood pressure testing., Medium term: within 6 months after initial diagnosis; long term: 30 years","Migraine Attack, Migraine attack is defined as any consistent migraine attacks or the use of specific migraine drugs. If a migraine attack is interrupted by sleep, or temporarily relieved, and then relapses within 48 hours, it is considered an attack. In addition, migraine attacks that were successfully treated with drugs but relapsed within 48 hours and lasted for more than 48 hours were counted as one attack., Medium term: within 6 months after initial diagnosis; long term: 30 years|The Response Rate of at Least 50%, 75% and 100% Reduction in the Number of Days of Migraine Attacks, The response rate is calculated as the percentage reduction in the frequency of migraine attacks (or days of migraine, or days of moderate or severe headache) compared with the baseline during each treatment period. The response rate is traditionally defined as a reduction of at least 50% from the baseline, but other percentage reductions (for example: 30%, 75%, 100%) may be used., Medium term: within 6 months after initial diagnosis; long term: 30 years|Headache Intensity, Four-point rating scale was used to evaluate the headache intensity of each migraine day--painless, mild, moderate, or severe. Migraine intensity is not recommended as the main outcome measure alone, but it is important to record the decrease in migraine intensity as an indicator of disability reduction.

Depending on the design of the trial, subjects should be asked to record the intensity of each migraine. In addition, the 11 point visual rating scale (VAS) can be used instead or in combination with the 4-level classification rating scale. The use of VAS in clinical trials may increase the likelihood of showing differences in severity., Medium term: within 6 months after initial diagnosis; long term: 30 years|Cumulative Hours of Moderate / Severe Pain, The cumulative number of hours of moderate / severe pain calculated by electronic headache diaries.

The measure uses a 1-week recall and contains 6 questions related to work productivity. The WPAI measures both presenteeism and absenteeism. The measure yields four scores expressed as impairment percentages ranging from 0 to 100%: Percent work time missed, percent impairment while working, percent overall work impairment, and percent activity impairment due to migraine., Medium term: within 6 months after initial diagnosis; long term: 30 years|European Quality of Life - 5 Dimensional (EQ-5D-5L), EQ-5D-5L is a generic instrument for use as a measure of health status. The EQ-5D-5L consists of 2 components - the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ VAS. The descriptive system comprises of 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). The respondent is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking (or placing a cross) in the box against the most appropriate statement in each of the 5 dimensions.

The scoring range of the EQ-5D descriptive system is typically from 0 (dead) to 1 (full health).

The EQ VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a vertical, VAS where the endpoints are labelled ""Best imaginable health state"" and ""Worst imaginable health state.""

It is divided into 3 domains: Role Function Restrictive assesses how migraines limit one's daily social and work-related activities; Role Function Preventive assesses how migraines prevent these activities; and the Emotional Function domain assesses the emotions associated with migraines. Participants respond to items using a 6-point scale ranging from ""none of the time"" to ""all of the time."" Raw dimension scores are computed as a sum of item responses and rescaled to a 0 to 100 scale, where higher scores indicate better quality of life., Medium term: within 6 months after initial diagnosis; long term: 30 years|Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Pain Interference - Short Form 6a (PROMIS-PI), The PROMIS-PI measures self-reported interference of pain on relevant aspects of daily life (ie, social, cognitive, emotional, physical, recreational) over the past 7 days. A 5-level response scale for all six items ranges from ""Not at all"" to ""Very much."" Scores range from 6 to 30, with higher scores indicating greater pain interference., Medium term: within 6 months after initial diagnosis; long term: 30 years|Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale, Suicidal ideation should be monitored in trials of central action drugs, higher scores mean a worse outcome.

Many migraine clinical trials used the Columbia suicide severity scale (C SSRS).The C-SSRS consists of a maximum of 20 items. C-SSRS will be administered in study subjects at each study visit to assess possible suicidal ideation and behavior. Reports of suicidal ideation with intent to act (endorse item 4 or 5) and reports of actual, aborted, or interrupted suicide attempts or a behavior preparatory for making an attempt indicate subjects at high risk for suicide., Medium term: within 6 months after initial diagnosis; long term: 30 years|Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), GAD-7 is a proven, self-administered and concise tool for screening and diagnosing mental health disorders, which has been tested in the field in office practice.

NCT05536635,Effect of Breathing Techniques on Migraine Attacks and Severity,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05536635,,COMPLETED,"Background:

Migraine is a very common neurobiological disorder caused by increased excitability of the Central Nervous System. It is among the causes of the highest morbidity worldwide. Migraine has considerable economic and social impact ; affects the quality of life of patients and disrupts work life, social activities and family life. To decrease the frequency and severity of migraine attacks may be the first goal than treating the attacks.

The study was designed as a Parallel Group, Add on, Randomized Controlled Experiment in order to observe the effects of breathing techniques on migraine-like headaches, frequency and severity.

Methods:

Participants will be divided into 2 parallel arms, intervention and control (treatment as usual). Cluster randomization will be performed to prevent intergroup contamination. Breathing techniques will be taught to the intervention group by the researcher. Both groups will continue to use pharmacotherapy for migraine. Both groups will be evaluated with migraine disability level (MIDAS) at the beginning and end of the study. The primary output of the study is to evaluate the effect of breathing techniques on the frequency and severity of attacks in migraine-like headaches. The secondary output is to evaluate the effect of breathing techniques on the MIDAS level.

There are 3 main parts:

1. Use of capsaicin (active ingredient in hot chili peppers) to trigger release of calcitonin gene related peptide - the hypothesis is that this will be different in headache subjects compared to controls (and if so might be used to predict how these patients will respond to certain medications that modulate calcitonin gene-related peptide). Subjects will be given capsaicin as a cream applied to the forehead or the inner nostril, or a hot sauce that is ingested.
2. Use of capsaicin to trigger eye watering - the hypothesis is that oxygen gas will slow down the amount of eye watering. Cluster headache patients respond very powerfully to oxygen gas but to very little else. The mechanism for oxygen is unknown but in rodents there is data that it works on the parasympathetic / lacrimal gland system. This study translates rodent data into humans in a non-invasive way to confirm the mechanism of this very effective treatment.

NCT06138171,"Personality, Defences, Central Sensitization, and Trauma in Women With Chronic Migraine, Fibromyalgia, and Vulvodynia",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06138171,PSYCHOFIBRO,COMPLETED,"Chronic pain (CP) is a substantial healthcare challenge with considerable economic costs. Recently, the term Nociplastic Pain (NP) has been introduced as a third descriptor of mechanisms related to CP. NP describes conditions that arise from altered nociception despite no clear evidence of actual or threatened tissue damage. It represents a new way of describing somatoform painful conditions, originating from altered central-nervous pathways (e.g., central sensitization) and with the important involvement of clinical psychological factors. Among nociplastic chronic syndromes have been included fibromyalgia (FM), chronic migraine (CM) and vulvodynia (VU). These chronic pain disorders have been usually studied separately, although the high comorbidity rates. Many studies evidenced the role of psychosocial variables in the onset and maintenance of the burden related to these conditions. Among them, personality traits, defense mechanisms, central sensitization, and childhood traumatic experiences may play a pivotal role in the onset of the NP. The first aim of this study is to highlight possible psychosocial clusters of variables that are specific for each condition (FM, CM, and VU). A second aim, to improve the tailored psychological treatment devoted to these conditions, is to explore the association between FM, CM, and VU with depression, anxiety, somatization, quality of life, alexithymia, social support, sexual satisfaction, and functioning. This will make it possible to identify specifically for each condition the areas of greatest interest that can be investigated and treated in clinical intervention. To identify specific descriptors, NP conditions will be compared with a control group of subjects reporting other types of CP (e.g., knee arthrosis, rheumatoid arthritis).

NCT05391295,Mapping Emotional Dynamics During Corticosteroid Treatment,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05391295,,RECRUITING,"Rationale: Synthetic glucocorticoids can result in neuropsychiatric adverse effects in a minority of patients. Although, not all patients experience severe adverse effects, more subtle emotional disturbances are often experienced. With a variation on ecological momentary assessment (EMA), with a daily assessment, the investigators will collect the patient's emotional symptoms in real time and in the patients natural environment during corticosteroid treatment. With dynamic time warping (DTW) analysis the investigators aim to analyse the temporal dynamics of different emotional states and visualize these emotional dynamics over time. The patient dermatologist and neurologist will receive the idiographic results as a feedback form, which may give insights into temporal (and possibly causal) central emotions, which may help to overcome mood disturbances.

Objective: Mapping emotional dynamics with DTW analysis in 6 mycosis fungoides or Sezary syndrome patients and 6 chronic cluster headache patients treated with systemic corticosteroids.

Study design: Case series report study. Study population: Six patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (type mycosis fungoides and/or Sezary syndrome), and six patients with cluster headache.

Main study parameters/endpoints: An idiographic DTW analysis of emotional dynamics during and after corticosteroid treatment in six mycosis fungoides and/or Sezary syndrome patients, and six chronic cluster headache patients.

Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: There are no additional risks associated with study participation.
