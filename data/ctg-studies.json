Subjects will receive a low dose of psilocybin during 3 sessions spaced by one week. Subjects will maintain a headache diary prior to, during, and after the administrations in order to document headache frequency, intensity and duration. Subjects will undergo a fMRI scanning before the first and after the last psilocybin session.","detailedDescription":"Cluster headache (CH) is one of the most painful conditions known. CH affects 1 out 1000 and exists in two well-defined forms: episodic (ECH) and chronic (CCH). Ten to fifteen percent of patients have CCH and have less than three months of pain-free time during a year. Medical treatment for CH is divided into acute abortive treatment for the single attack and a prophylactic treatment. The most commonly used prophylactic, verapamil, decreases attack frequency but does not induce remission and very high doses are needed. Although most therapeutic options ameliorate CH, they may be problematic due to major side effects, unsatisfactory treatment response or availability. Thus, novel treatment options are needed. According to several studies, patients that self-medicate with low doses of the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) agonist and psychedelic psilocybin report that this is effective as CH prophylaxis or even to induce remission. So far, no clinical trials to confirm this have been conducted, nor is there any objective measures of brain function in association with psilocybin intake in CH. There is, however, already some evidence from functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) imaging studies suggesting that CH patients have abnormal functional connectivity patterns involving the hypothalamus and distributed brain networks, but the implication of these abnormalities is unknown.\n\nThe investigators are conducting a prospective pilot study, evaluating prophylactic effects of psilocybin in CCH using an open-label study design. They're also going to investigate psilocybin's active metabolite psilocin and brain function (fMRI) to identify possible brain mechanisms underlying CCH and treatment response, including the correlation of treatment response with psilocin levels and estimated 5-HT2AR occupancy and the extent to which brain network changes are affected by psilocybin and correlated with treatment response.\n\nEffects of psilocybin on headache frequency, duration and intensity will be assessed in a sample of 20 patients with CCH. Participants will fill out headache logs during the entire study period, in total 10 weeks. Before study inclusion, participants taking prophylactic medication will first go through a 2-week wash-out period to allow for elimination of the medicine. Inclusion is followed by a baseline observation period lasting four weeks, after which patients will first undergo a baseline rs fMRI scanning followed by the first dose of 0.14 mg/kg psilocybin p.o. Blood samples will be collected during the first psilocybin intervention to establish psilocin plasma concentrations, which will be used for estimating receptor occupancy. Participants will then undergo two additional psilocybin administrations spaced by one-week. The last psilocybin dose will be followed by 4 weeks of observation. One week after the last administration of psilocybin, participants will undergo a follow-up MRI scan. Participants will be contacted 3, 6 and 12 months after the last psilocybin dose to gain information about the duration of potential remission periods. All regular acute treatments are permitted during the study period and a systematic record hereof has to be noted in the headache diary. No other prophylactic medication is allowed during the trial and at least a two-week washout period before inclusion is required. Prophylactics are allowed again after the 4 weeks follow-up, with dose and type carefully recorded. Participants will fill out questionnaires during the observation period, in conjunction with psilocybin interventions and at follow-up."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cluster Headache"],"keywords":["Cluster Headache","Psilocybin","Prophylactic","Treatment","Hallucinogens"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Psilocybin","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Psilocybin"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Psilocybin","description":"0.14 mg/kg p.o. in three sessions spaced by one week","armGroupLabels":["Psilocybin"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Headache frequency","description":"Change in headache frequency in number of attacks/week","timeFrame":"Week 6-10 (post drug observation) compared to week 0-4 (baseline observation)"},{"measure":"Resting state FC fMRI analyses","description":"Resting state FC fMRI analyses, including hypothalamic FC, comparing baseline and rescan, comparison with healthy control sample, and evaluation of correlation between headache frequency changes and FC changes.","timeFrame":"Day 1 of first psilocybin session to 1 week after last psilocybin session (3 weeks)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of reduced frequency","description":"Proportion of patients with a 50% reduction in headache frequency","timeFrame":"Week 6-10 (post drug observation) compared to week 0-4 (baseline observation)"},{"measure":"Headache intensity","description":"Change in average headache intensity of attacks (0-10 on Visual Analog Scale (VAS), where 0 is no pain and 10 is worst pain imaginable)","timeFrame":"Week 6-10 (post drug observation) compared to week 0-4 (baseline observation)"},{"measure":"Need of acute therapy","description":"Number of attacks requiring acute therapy","timeFrame":"Week 6-10 (post drug observation) compared to week 0-4 (baseline observation)"},{"measure":"Sideeffects","description":"Proportion of patients experiencing serious side effects","timeFrame":"Whole observation period (10 weeks)"},{"measure":"Remission","description":"Proportion of patients with remission lasting more than 1 month","timeFrame":"Day 1 after first psilocybin session until 12 month follow up (1 year)."},{"measure":"Remission duration","description":"Duration of induced remission (number of weeks)","timeFrame":"Day 1 after first psilocybin session until 12 month follow up (1 year)."},{"measure":"SF-36","description":"Quality of life assessed by questionnaires: The Short Form (36) Health Survey.

In clinical anecdotes, people with cluster headache frequently report use of tobacco and illicit drugs. Furthermore, addictive behaviours and tattoos are considered to be more common in people with cluster headache than in the general population. The causality of these associations remains unclear. A common biological susceptibility has been proposed, predisposing people to both addictive behaviour and cluster headache. On the other hand, a role of illicit drug exposure in cluster headache pathophysiology has been suggested. The increased use of tobacco and illicit drugs could also reflect attempts to treat cluster headache attacks. In this explorative study the investigators will assess both subjective and objective measures reflecting addictive behaviour and risk- and reward seeking in cluster headache.

In 5 cases taken from Krusz J.C. headache clinic data in Dallas, Texas US, an intranasal spray of ketamine aqueous solution of 100 µL in one nostril were dosed in treatment of patients with refractory chronic cluster headache as an alternative to IV-treatment (data not published).The net conclusion, at this point, is that intranasal ketamine is a legitimate pharmacologic treatment and is safe and has in one case series proven effective for CH rescue.\n\nThe CCH patients will be dosed with an intranasal spray containing 172.5 mg ketamine hydrochloride (150 mg ketamine base) per ml in an aqueous solution. The individual dosing includes 15 mg ketamine in an intranasal sprayed volume of 100 µL given in one nose nostril under supervision of a nurse. The treatment is initiated at T0 under a CH attack when the headache pain exceeds NRS = 6 on an NRS pain scale. The first intranasal dose of 15 mg is given at time 0 and at time intervals of 6 minutes.

The life-time prevalence of cluster headache for adults of all ages is around 125/100,000, or approximately 0.1%, with clear male dominance (4:1). Prophylactic treatment is an important part of the total management of cluster headache patients, having twofold goals: i) to reduce the frequency, painfulness, and/or duration of headache attacks, and ii) to increase the effectiveness of abortive therapy. During the past several decades, a large number of optional modalities have been tested as preventive measures of cluster headache. Not unexpectedly, the effects of any such preventive therapies are highly variable, and in many patients, the attack frequency is not under satisfactory control. Many of these drugs also have untoward side effects that offset their potential benefits.\n\nRecently, spontaneous case testimonials were received by Biohit Oyj from migraine patients (and one with cluster headache) reporting that our new medical device, Acetium™ capsule (containing 100mg l-cysteine, developed for inactivation of acetaldehyde in the stomach contents after alcohol intake), proved to be highly effective against their headache attacks. Their attacks disappeared almost immediately after onset of L-cysteine administration, all of them remaining in complete remission for several months up to several years.\n\nThese spontaneous testimonials prompted us to formulate a novel study hypothesis that could possibly explain this dramatic effect of L-cysteine in prevention of headache attacks, to be tested in this RCT. This novel hypothesis is starting from the fact that, in cluster headache (a vascular-type of headache), swelling and dilatation of the blood vessels is necessary to provoke the attack.\n\nIt is known that Nitric Oxide (NO) is the final trigger of vascular headache attack, operating through phosphorylated protein kinase G (PKG) and Ca2+ channels, slowing the influx of calcium into the cell, which leads to smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation. Histamine is a potent inducer of NO Synthase, making NO available locally on the vasculature, acting through endothelial H1-receptors. Histamine is synthesized from histidine in tissue mast cells, which are ubiquitous cells and their activation e.g. in the meninges has long been suspected to be involved in generating migraine headaches. Finally, one of the potent liberators of histamine from the mast cells is acetaldehyde, which, in turn, is effectively inactivated by L-cysteine (Acetium capsule). This led us to rational that by eliminating acetaldehyde in the stomach, L-cysteine could block (or reduce below the threshold levels) histamine liberation from the tissue mast cells and ECL cells in the stomach, thus arresting its multitude of functions, of which vasodilatation is critically involved in the cluster headache attack.\n\nObjective: To validate the novel hypothesis that daily use of L-cysteine (Acetium capsules, 100mg twice a day) is an effective means to decrease the frequency of (or completely abort) the headache attacks in patients suffering from cluster headache.\n\nStudy design: A double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled multi-centre trial comparing Acetium capsules (100mg L-cysteine, twice a day) and placebo in prevention of headache attacks during a 1-month trial period. In brief, a cohort of 60 (up to100) voluntary subjects (women and men, with periodic or chronic cluster headache) are invited through the Finnish Migraine Association (FMA). To be eligible for the study, the subjects should: i) have the frequency of typical attacks up to 5 per day; ii) age between 18 and 65 years; and iii) have a minimum of co-morbidity. There are no restrictions on duration since the diagnosis, or the age at the onset of cluster headache. They should discontinue other prophylactic medication prior to study entry. Before enrolment, all subjects are requested to sign a written consent. The study protocol will be subjected for approval by the Committee on Medical Research Ethics (HUS).\n\nMethods: The study setting is triple-blinded (participant-blind, investigator-blind, sponsor-blind). Placebo preparation with design and package identical to the test preparation will be used. Parallel group design instead of cross-over design is used. Randomization will be performed using a random number generator, with block size of 4, and stratified by gender.\n\nThe treatment period in both study arms will be 1 month. The participants should use (but accurately report) their usual symptomatic or acute treatment, because not anticipated to interfere with the study medication. During the 1-month treatment period, participants will be evaluated at weekly intervals by the study coordinator.\n\nIn addition to the baseline assessment of attack frequency, each subject will be requested to fill in a structured Questionnaire recoding their detailed headache history and other pertinent data on potential triggers. The headache diary is the main research tool used to monitor the efficacy of the test preparations, recording all predefined assessment measures (efficacy, tolerability and safety), and submitted to the study monitor on each FU visit.\n\nIn statistical analysis, both conventional techniques (e.g. non-parametric paired-samples and non-paired samples t-test), and more sophisticated methods will be used. The latter include i) life-table methods like Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards regression, as well as ii) generalized linear models (GEE and panel Poisson) and as a new technique in cluster headache RCTs, a competing risks regression to model the natural outcomes of the headache during the intervention. This study (n=60; the most modest scenario) is adequately powered (Type II error 0.80, type I error 0.05) to detect a true difference in attack frequency between 15 attacks/week in the placebo and 13.1 attacks/week in the Acetium arm. Given that the study subjects are enrolled among patients with typically 1-3 attacks/day, i.e., 7-21 (up to 35) attacks per week, and assuming a 10% reduction by placebo, there figures seem reasonable estimates for these power calculations.\n\nSpecific aims: The null hypothesis of the study implicates that l-cysteine is no better than placebo in prophylaxis of cluster headache during the 1-month intervention period. Rejection or not of the null hypothesis is based on comparison of the two arms for the primary study endpoint and (to lesser extent) for a series of secondary endpoints. The primary study endpoint (efficacy measure) is the number of attacks per week. Potentially useful secondary endpoints include: i) intensity of headache (4-tier nominal scale); ii) drug consumption for symptomatic or acute treatment; and iii) patients' preferences and satisfaction.\n\nStudy execution and time table: Meanwhile the final protocol is under evaluation for ethical approval by HUS, preparatory measures have been taken by informing the FMA about the planned study and asking their co-operation in encouraging the interested migraine patients to contact the study coordinator. Given the preliminary interest shown by the FMA, we are optimistic that the required cohort of volunteers can be enrolled within a short time, most likely by the end of 2013. However, because the subjects with episodic cluster headache must be enrolled during their on-going cluster episodes that typically follow a seasonal pattern, the enrolment of the total cohort (even n=60) inevitably needs to be completed over several months (up to one year).\n\nImpact of the study: Given that L-cysteine is a natural (semi-essential) amino acid, converted to inert substance (MTCA) in the alimentary tract, it would comprise an ideal means to conduct prophylaxis of cluster headaches for years, without concern about the side effects that are inherent to many of the current treatment modalities. If the efficacy is proven in this formal RCT, the concept of using Acetium capsules in prophylactic treatment of cluster headache would represent a major step forward in a better clinical control of these frequently excruciating headaches."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cluster Headache"],"keywords":["Cluster headache","Migrainous neuralgia","Horton's headache","Histaminic cephalalgia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Acetium","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patient will administer Acetium capsules (100mg l-cysteine) twice a day for one month","interventionNames":["Drug: Acetium"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Patient will administer placebo capsules twice a day for one month","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Acetium","description":"Capsule for oral administration contains L-cysteine 100mg","armGroupLabels":["Acetium"],"otherNames":["Acetium capsule"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"A placebo capsule matching Acetium for oral administration.","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"],"otherNames":["Acetium capsule placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The frequency of headache attacks per week","description":"The frequency of headache attacks per week, either during the entire treatment period or during the last treatment interval is compared with the baseline frequencies, to disclose differences between the two study arms.","timeFrame":"1 month"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* 18-65 years male/female\n* episodic and chronic cluster headache\n* the subjects should report cluster headache attacks with the frequency from one every second day up to five per day.

CH is characterized by a multifaceted and incompletely understood pathophysiology. The hypothalamus, the trigeminal-vascular complex, and the trigeminal-autonomic reflex are believed to play a significant role.\n\nIncreasing experimental evidence has highlighted the involvement of specific microRNAs (miRNAs) in the chronic pain and primary headaches, including migraine. miRNAs are small endogenous noncoding RNAs that are around 22 nucleotides in length. miRNAs operate as post-transcriptional regulator of gene expression by promoting messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation or repressing mRNA translation. The regulation process performed by miRNAs is complex and articulated since an individual miRNA might target hundreds of different mRNAs, and conversely, each mRNA may be regulated by multiple miRNAs. It has been estimated that more than 60% of all protein-coding genes are regulated by miRNAs which consequentially determine the pleiotropic modulation of a wide variety of cellular processes involving differentiation, development and signaling. miRNAs are involved in the generation and maintenance of pain and several evidence suggest that specific miRNAs could play a role in migraine.\n\nIn a recent study, we observed an upregulation of gene expression in two miRNAs, miR-382-5p and miR-34a-5p, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in subjects with chronic migraine (CM). These miRNAs are involved in inflammation modulation and the release of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) compared to individuals with episodic migraine and healthy subjects (HCs). These findings underscore a correlation between the gene expression of these miRNAs and the migraine phenotype, as well as its severity.\n\nRecent studies suggest an active role for certain neuropeptides in CH. The Danish group has indeed demonstrated that the intravenous administration of CGRP, PACAP, or VIP can induce acute CH attacks in at least 50% of participants when studied in the active phase of the disease.\n\nAs of now, there is no data regarding the potential involvement of miRNAs in CH. This study aims to provide a detailed exploration of the role of miRNAs in cluster headache, contributing to our understanding of the pathophysiology of this primary headache disorder. Furthermore, the results obtained may pave the way for the development of a new generation of molecules that could be used in the field of CH, such as miRNA agonists (Agomir) and antagonists (Antagomir).\n\nAims The primary objective of our current project is to investigate the peripheral expression of miRNAs implicated in pain modulation (miR-382-5p, miR-34a-5p, and miR-155) in subjects with episodic CH in the active phase (eCH-act), episodic CH in the remission phase (eCH-rem), chronic CH (cCH), and healthy control subjects (HC).\n\nMethods\n\nAll subjects will perform a single evaluation over time during which they will undergo:\n\n* explanation of study procedures and informed consent signing\n* screening visit\n* clinical and demographic data collection (based on revision of a headache diary)\n* fasting venous blood sampling\n* administration of questionnaires\n\nAll subjects will be evaluated in the morning, after night fasting. For subjects affected by cCH or eCH-act, sampling is expected to be carried out in the inter-critical phase, as defined by the absence of CH attacks for at least 3 hours in patients with eCH and for at least 8 hours in patients with cCH. After blood sampling, patients will stay at Center to complete a set of questionnaires. This will allow the investigator to monitor the patients for at least 2 hours, to exclude that a blood sampling is performed immediately before a CH attack.\n\nFor patients with eCH, the \"active\" and \"remission\" phases will be defined as follows:\n\n* Active phase: the phase during which CH attacks have been present for at least 7 days.\n* Remission phase: characterized by an absence of cluster headache attacks for at least 15 consecutive days without pharmacological therapy.\n\nmiR-382-5p, miR-34a-5p and miRNA-155 gene expression will be evaluated in PBMCs by real-time reverse transcription (RT-PCR). This assessment will be normalized with U6 (a type of small nuclear RNA used as housekeeping gene) and expressed as Relative Quantification (RQ). Plasma levels of CGRP alpha, PACAP and VIP will be measured using validated commercial ELISA kits. A detailed description of the methods planned for the biochemical analyses could be found here: https://doi.org/10.1186/s10194-020-01189-0.\n\nThe set of clinical questionnaires will include: Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS), Headache Impact Test (HIT-6), Cluster headache Impact Questionnarie (CHIQ).\n\nSample size calculation and pre-planned statistical analysis The following parameters were considered for the calculation: Effect Size: 0.5; alpha error: 0.05; beta error: 0.05 (power: 95%); number of groups: 4.\n\nSample size calculation was conducted using the freeware platform G\\*Power (ver. 3.1.9.7) for an ANOVA test with Bonferroni correction applied to the 4 groups. The minimum suggested sample size is 76 subjects (19 subjects per group). To account for potential variability, we plan to enroll a total of 100 subjects, with 25 subjects per group.\n\nParametric or non-parametric correlations will be used to measure the relationship between biochemical variables and clinical variables. Multivariate analyses will be performed according to the results of the univariate analysis.

In contrast, patients with episodic cluster headache will be asked to contact the study coordinator at the onset of their next cluster cycle, at which point they will repeat the screening and then start their one-week baseline headache diary. After establishing the baseline headache frequency, severity, and abortive medicine use, patients will be asked to start their first dose of study drug with their next moderate to severe cluster headache. They will rate their pain for this headache on a 5 point severity scale (\"no headache,\" \"mild,\" \"moderate,\" \"severe\" or \"very severe\" and rate the pain on a scale of 0 to 10 (\"0\" is no pain and \"10\" is most severe pain imaginable) at the time of taking rimegepant and rate the pain again at 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes after taking the drug. 60 or more minutes after taking the rimegepant, they are allowed to use their usual standard of care for the acute/abortive treatment of acute cluster attacks. After this first dose, they will then take rimegepant on an every other day schedule for a total of 4 doses over 8 days.

The headache may be episodic or chronic. Treatment options are limited and their effects unsatisfactory. An important nerve pathway involved in the pain attacks has a switching station at the sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) located in the depth of the facial bones. SPG is a known therapy target for cluster headache. The area can be identified on CT images, but is difficult to access due to its location. Thus, the Multiguide navigation system has been developed to enable precise delivery of the drugs that target SPG activity. In Trondheim, two phase 1 / Phase 2 study have been carried out using botulinum toxin A (Botox®) against SPG in patient with chronic cluster headache and chronic migraine. The results indicate that such a treatment strategy is safe and beneficial. The current study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, triple-blinded study to investigate whether precise single-injection of botulinum toxin A reduces the frequency of attacks in chronic cluster headache ."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cluster Headache"],"keywords":["Botulinum Toxin Type A","Sphenopalatine Ganglion Block","Autonomic Nerve Block","Injections"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":112,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Botox injections towards SPG","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Botulinum Toxin type A injections","interventionNames":["Drug: Botulinum toxin type A"]},{"label":"Controls","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"placebo injections","interventionNames":["Drug: placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Botulinum toxin type A","description":"Botulinum toxin 25 Allergan units in 0.5 ml Sodium Chloride (NaCl) 0.9 % Braun.

Specifically, LSD has been reported to abort attacks, to decrease frequency and intensity of attacks, and to induce remission in patients suffering from cluster headache (CH).\n\nObjective: To investigate the effects of an oral LSD pulse regimen (3 x 100 µg LSD in three weeks) in patients suffering from CH compared with placebo.\n\nDesign: Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled two-phase cross-over study design.\n\nParticipants: 30 patients aged ≥ 25 and ≤ 75 years with chronic or episodic CH with predictable periods lasting approximately 2 months and attacks responding to oxygen.\n\nMain outcome measures: Changes in frequency and intensity of CH attacks assessed with a standardized headache diary Significance: CH is often rated as the most painful of all primary headaches, which not only causes significant disability, but is also associated with enormous personal, economic, and psychiatric burden. At the moment, there is no specific treatment available for CH, but serotonergic compounds represent an important drug class, especially in the abortive management of cluster attacks. However, there is a need for new treatment approaches, as CH is also often insufficiently managed with available medication. This study will evaluate the potential benefit and safety of a treatment with LSD for patients with CH."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cluster Headache"],"keywords":["lysergic acid diethylamide

It is a low-cost and safe treatment option; however, the beneficial effects are limited to weeks to months. This makes the injection suitable for episodic cluster headache, where periods with headache attacks last weeks to months. However, the effect of repeated GON-injections has never been studied in a double-blind randomized trial as a prophylactic therapy in a well-documented group of chronic patients. As such, (repeated) GON-injection has not yet found its place in current (inter)national treatment protocols for chronic cluster headache. The injection is often only used as a last-resort treatment in a very limited number of headache centres in a trial-and-error approach with a treatment interval varying between 3 and 6 months. It is, therefore, not known what chronic cluster headache patients can expect from this treatment.\n\nHypothesis: Repeated GON-injections are a safe, well-tolerated, convenient, and cost-effective therapy to rapidly and long-term reduce the attack frequency in chronic cluster headache."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cluster Headache"],"keywords":["GON-injection"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Bi-centre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled retention trial","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Placebo Arm","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug: Saline solution"]},{"label":"Intervention Arm","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Methylprednisolone"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Methylprednisolone","description":"Injection with prednisolon","armGroupLabels":["Intervention Arm"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Saline solution","description":"0,9%","armGroupLabels":["Placebo Arm"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"mean number of days, from first injection until discontinuation, study participants remain using study medication (retention rate in survival curve)","timeFrame":"1 year"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Frequency of weekly cluster headache attacks vs. baseline","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"Mean duration of attacks vs. baseline","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"Mean severity (1-10) of attacks vs. baseline","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"Proportion of study participants with >50% or 100% reduction in attack frequency vs. baseline","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"Median injection interval","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"Adverse events","timeFrame":"1 year"},{"measure":"Ultrasound structural integrity of the greater occipital nerve","timeFrame":"1 year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age ≥18 and ≤ 70 years\n* Chronic cluster headache (International Classification of Headache Disorders - third edition; ICHD-3)\n* Ictal pain must be always at the same side\n* ≥4 weekly attacks of cluster headache in the prospective one-month baseline observation period\n* On a stable regimen of cluster headache prophylactics for \\>4 weeks prior to onset of study treatment and agreeing not to increase the dose and not starting a new cluster prophylactic during the study period\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Contra-indication against, or current use of, corticosteroids\n* Occipital nerve stimulation (ONS)\n* Use of anticoagulation medication or a known bleeding disorder\n* Inability to use an electronic diary to monitor individual attacks and other items\n* Other headaches if the patient cannot reliably distinguish them from attacks of cluster headache\n* Current use of prophylactic medication for other headaches\n* Pregnancy","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"70 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Willemijn Naber","role":"CONTACT","phone":"0715262587","email":"w.c.naber@lumc.nl"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Leiden University Medical Center","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Leiden","country":"Netherlands","contacts":[{"name":"Willemijn Naber","role":"CONTACT"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":52.15833,"lon":4.49306}},{"facility":"Canisius Wilhelmina Ziekenhuis","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Nijmegen","country":"Netherlands","contacts":[{"name":"Wim Mulleners","role":"CONTACT"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":51.8425,"lon":5.85278}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2025-10-02"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D003027","term":"Cluster Headache"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D051303","term":"Trigeminal Autonomic Cephalalgias"},{"id":"D051270","term":"Headache Disorders, Primary"},{"id":"D020773","term":"Headache Disorders"},{"id":"D001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D008775","term":"Methylprednisolone"},{"id":"D000077330","term":"Saline Solution"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D011239","term":"Prednisolone"},{"id":"D011246","term":"Pregnadienetriols"},{"id":"D011245","term":"Pregnadienes"},{"id":"D011278","term":"Pregnanes"},{"id":"D013256","term":"Steroids"},{"id":"D000072473","term":"Fused-Ring Compounds"},{"id":"D011083","term":"Polycyclic Compounds"},{"id":"D000077324","term":"Crystalloid Solutions"},{"id":"D007552","term":"Isotonic Solutions"},{"id":"D012996","term":"Solutions"},{"id":"D004364","term":"Pharmaceutical Preparations"}]}},"hasResults":false},

A parasympathetic dysfunction in CH has been suggested. The sphenopalatine ganglion has been a target for treatment of primary headache disorders for more than a century but there are several anatomic and physiologic studies that suggest that another cranial parasympathetic ganglion, the otic ganglion (OG), might be also relevant in CH. In this study OG will be blocked with botulinum toxin type A in a pilot study in 10 patients with chronic cluster headache. Recruitment of patients will be solely in Norway. There is no data available to determine the correct dosage of botulinum toxin. A similar neural structure that has been blocked with botulinum toxin in humans is the sphenopalatine ganglion. The investigators injected 10 patients suffering from intractable chronic cluster headache with botulinum toxin in the sphenopalatine ganglion. 5 patients were given 25 IU and 5 patients were given 50 IU. Even though the number of treated patients is low, there did not appear to be differences in the adverse events profile between those who received 25 Iu and those who received 50 IU. The investigators also previously injected 25 IU botulinum toxin towards the sphenopalatine ganglion bilaterally (i.e. 25 IU in each side) in 10 patients suffering from intractable chronic migraine. Doses of up to 25 IU have been injected in structures adjacent to the otic ganglion, for instance in dystonia towards the lateral pterygoid muscle. Thus it was decided for this study on injection towards the otic ganglion, to explore the safety of 12.5 and 25 IU of botulinum toxin."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cluster Headache"],"keywords":["Nerve block","Ganglia, Parasympathetic","Botulinum Toxins, Type A","Injection"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Botulinum Toxin 25 IU","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"5 patients will be injected with 25 IU of Botulinum Toxin Type A towards the otic ganglion in the symptomatic side (ipsilateral to the pain)","interventionNames":["Drug: Botulinum Toxin Type A 25 IU"]},{"label":"Botulinum Toxin 12.5 IU","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"5 patients will be injected with 12.5 IU of Botulinum Toxin Type A towards the otic ganglion in the symptomatic side (ipsilateral to the pain)","interventionNames":["Drug: Botulinum Toxin Type A 12.5 IU"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Botulinum Toxin Type A 25 IU","description":"injection with 25 IU botulinum toxin towards the otic ganglion (symptomatic side) using image-guided navigation and the MultiGuide device","armGroupLabels":["Botulinum Toxin 25 IU"],"otherNames":["Botox","BTA","Allergan"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Botulinum Toxin Type A 12.5 IU","description":"injection with 12.5 IU botulinum toxin towards the otic ganglion (symptomatic side) using image-guided navigation and the MultiGuide device","armGroupLabels":["Botulinum Toxin 12.5 IU"],"otherNames":["Botox","BTA","Allergan"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of adverse events (AE)","description":"All adverse events will be registered.

The headache is believed to be the most intense of all headaches and among many is totally disabling and of great personal and social consequences. For a small group of patients with episodic and most chronic form, drug therapy has little effect. For them, surgery can be a solution.\n\nNeuroradiology has found evidence of a possible original activation of cluster headache from the portion of the brain called hypothalamus. Furthermore, an activation of the parasympathetic nervous system through the sphenopalatine ganglion, which may also explain some of the one-sided involuntary symptoms, is suspected in cluster headache. Injection of Botulinum toxin type A (BTA) inhibits secretion of synaptic acetylcholine resulting in nerve signals being blocked. The duration of such a blockade is believed to be 3-9 months.\n\nThe purpose of the present study is to develop and evaluate a new surgical procedure with injection of BTA for blocking of the sphenopalatine ganglion. The goal is to relieve the symptoms of refractory cluster headache with a minimal invasive procedure.\n\nThe main objective of the project is to determine the safety of BTA injection in the area of the sphenopalatine ganglion of refractory cluster headache and detect the adverse events. Secondary objectives are to identify the changes of headache attacks by the method used."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cluster Headache"],"keywords":["Cluster Headache","Botulinum Toxin Type A","Sphenopalatine Ganglion Block","Autonomic Nerve Block"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Botulinum Toxin Type A 25 IU","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The first five patients will be injected 25 IU of Botulinum Toxin Type A","interventionNames":["Drug: Botulinum Toxin Type A 25 IU"]},{"label":"Botulinum Toxin Type A 50 IU","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"the next five patients will receive 50 IU of Botulinum Toxin Type A","interventionNames":["Drug: Botulinum Toxin Type A 50 IU"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Botulinum Toxin Type A 25 IU","armGroupLabels":["Botulinum Toxin Type A 25 IU"],"otherNames":["Botox"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Botulinum Toxin Type A 50 IU","armGroupLabels":["Botulinum Toxin Type A 50 IU"],"otherNames":["Botox"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Safety aspects / Number of adverse events and number of participants with adverse events as a measure of safety","description":"Number of adverse events and number of participants with adverse events after BTA injection in the area of the sphenopalatine ganglion and severity of adverse events.

The goal of acute therapy for cluster headache is fast, effective and consistent relief.\n\nIn the currently recommended dosing strategy of continuous flow 100% oxygen given via a non-rebreather face mask at 7-15L/min, the time to improvement can sometimes take upwards of 20-30 minutes and is not effective for all cluster headache sufferers.\n\nAn alternative method of oxygen delivery (versus continuous flow) uses a demand valve which is controlled by the respiration rate, allowing increased oxygen flow in response to increased demand. This delivery system may be better at stopping a cluster headache attack than the continuous flow model as it can support hyperventilation which can enhance cerebral arterial vasoconstriction via a state of hyperoxia and hypocapnia. Arterial vasoconstriction is one hypothesized method by which oxygen can abort a cluster headache attack.\n\nThis proof of concept trial will evaluate if oxygen delivered via demand valve with a specific breathing technique is effective as a cluster headache acute treatment and is more effective than the traditional continuous high flow oxygen treatment with a non-rebreather face mask."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cluster Headache"],"keywords":["Headache","Cluster Headache","Oxygen Therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":4,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Continous Flow Oxygen","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug: Oxygen"]},{"label":"Oxygen Demand Valve","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Oxygen"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Oxygen","description":"A demand valve delivers oxygen to the user as soon as they try to inhale from an attached mask or mouth tube.

This study seeks to determine the safety and efficacy of the commercially available 4mg StatDose formulation of sumatriptan as an acute treatment of cluster headache. Patients are allowed to use repeated dose of the study medication for a given headache if they have had a partial response to the first dose. They may treat up to 3 attacks of cluster headache with the study medication. Safety assessment will be through adverse event reporting and physical examination. Patients with both episodic cluster headache as well as chronic cluster headache will be studied. Patients must either not have started preventive treatment for cluster headache or be on a stable dose of preventive medication.","detailedDescription":"This is an open label trial of sumatriptan 4 mg using the StatDose injector system for the treatment of acute attacks of cluster headache.\n\nPatient entering the trial must either be in the first 3 weeks of an episodic cluster headache cycle or have chronic cluster headache.

Patients with chronic cluster headache must be on a stable regimen of preventive medications.\n\nPatients must be in good health with no contraindications to the use of sumatriptan such as either having or having increased risk factors for CAD or CVD. They may not take during the time of the study preventive medications that are 5HT1B/1D agonists. Episodic use of triptans, ergotamine, or dihydroergotamine is permitted provided they are not used within 24 hours of use of the study medication.\n\nPatients will be required to treat 3 acute attacks of cluster headache with the study medication or to use more than 1 dose of study medication to fully treat an individual attack of cluster headache with a maximum of 3 doses of the study medication within a 24 hour time frame.\n\nEfficacy of the study medication will be determined from diary data collected.

Patients who are currently in a cluster cycle will be treated with 2 consecutive days of IV Depacon followed by oral Depakote ER. Patients will receive a total of 1,000mg of Depacon and 1,000mg of Depakote ER each day. Patients may have a 3rd day of IV Depacon followed by oral Depakote ER if the primary investigator believes it to be beneficial. The patient is then sent home on oral Depakote ER. The dose of Depakote ER can range from 500mg to 2,000mg this dose is to be determined by the primary investigator. The patient will continue the oral Depakote ER until the end of their cluster cycle or for a maximum of 6 weeks, which ever comes first.","detailedDescription":"This study will consist of four visits (3 visits if the screening visit and first treatment visit are on the same day).\n\nScreening Visit:\n\nThe screening visit can be performed either before an active cluster period or once the cluster period has already started. If the subject agrees to participate, the study doctor will determine if they are eligible for this study. The subject will be asked about their headache history, and medical history including all medications they are currently taking. A brief physical examination and neurologic examination will be performed and vital signs (pulse and blood pressure) will be measured. If the subject is a woman who is capable of bearing children, they will be asked to provide a urine sample for a routine pregnancy test. A blood sample (approximately 2 teaspoons) will also be obtained. Blood samples will be taken for a liver function test (LFT), complete blood count (CBC) with differential, chemistry profile, prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT).If the screening visit is the same day as the first treatment visit, this blood work will be sent for immediate analysis. The results must be reviewed and approved by the study physician prior to the subject being administered study medication.\n\nTreatment Visit One:\n\nIf the subject does not undergo treatment at the screening visit because they are not in an active cluster period, the subject will be asked to contact the site once their next cluster period begins. Subjects will be scheduled to come for their first treatment visit as soon as possible.\n\nIf the screening visit is not the same day as the first treatment visit, the study physician and or delegated research staff will re-explain the informed consent, ask the subject to re-read the informed consent and verbally re-confirm their agreement to participate in this trial.\n\nThe research staff will then determine whether the subject continues to qualify for the research trial. They will ask the subject about any changes in their medications since their last visit and/or any changes in their medical conditions since their last visit. Vital signs will be measured and if the subject is a woman of childbearing potential a urine sample will be obtained for routine pregnancy testing. A brief physical examination and neurologic examination will be performed by the study physician. The subject will be given a diary to take home with instructions on how to complete it. The subject will be scheduled to return to the study office the next day.\n\nOnce all of the above procedures have been completed, the research staff will then ask the subject to lie down in an exam room. They research nurse or study physician will then administer one of the study medications (Depacon) through an IV placed in their arm. Subjects will receive 1000mg of Depacon IV. This medication will be infused (administered) over a five minute period. The subjects' vital signs will be measured at 3 minutes, 5 minutes and 15 minutes after the medication has been completely administered.\n\nThe subject will remain in the study office for one hour for observation. Subjects will be closely monitored and repeatedly queried for the development of adverse events. Appropriate intervention and follow-up will be applied as deemed necessary by the investigator.\n\nPrior to leaving the office, the research nurse or study physician will give the subject an oral dose of the second study medication, 1000mg of Depakote ER.\n\nTreatment Visit Two:\n\nThe subject will return to the study office the next day for their second treatment visit. The study staff will review the subject's diary and record their vital signs. The subject's take home diary will be re-dispensed. The subject will then undergo the same infusion procedure as in their first treatment visit. Subjects will again receive a total of 1000mg of Depacon IV. Subjects will be closely monitored and repeatedly queried for the development of adverse events. Appropriate intervention and follow-up will be applied as deemed necessary by the investigator.\n\nPrior to leaving the office, the research nurse or study physician will give the subject an oral dose of the second study medication, 1000mg of Depakote ER.\n\nThe subject may or may not be asked to return the next day for a third treatment day depending on the study physicians' review of their response to study treatment. If it is determined that the subject does not need to return for a third treatment day, a blood sample will be obtained from a vein in their arm. The subject will also be given a take home supply of the oral study drug Depakote ER with instructions. The subject will be scheduled to return to the study office in 6 weeks OR when their current cluster cycle ends, whichever comes first.\n\nThe research staff will contact the subject bi-weekly to see how they are doing and to confirm that they are taking your study drug appropriately. The research staff will also ask the subject if they have had any unwanted experiences since their last contact with the site. The subject will be instructed to call the study site should they have any questions or have any unwanted experiences.\n\nTreatment Visit Three:\n\nIf the study physician determines that the subject should return for a third treatment day, the subject will return to the study office the day after their second treatment visit. The same infusion procedures will be performed. The study staff will review the subject's diary and record their vital signs. A blood sample (2 teaspoons) will be obtained from a vein in their arm. Prior to leaving the office, the research nurse or study physician will give the subject an oral dose of the second study medication, Depakote ER.\n\nThe subject will be given a take home supply of the oral study drug Depakote ER with instructions. Subjects will be instructed to take 2000mg of Depakote ER once a day. The subject will be scheduled to return to the study office in 6 weeks OR when their current cluster cycle ends, whichever comes first. The research staff will contact the subject bi-weekly to see how they are doing and to confirm that they are taking your study drug appropriately. The research staff will also ask whether or not the subject had any unusual symptoms, or out of the ordinary experiences since their last contact with the site. The subject will be instructed to call the study site should they have any questions or have any unwanted experiences.\n\nFinal Visit:\n\nThe final visit to the study office will occur either 6 weeks after the subjects last treatment visit OR when the subjects current cluster cycle ends, whichever comes first. At this visit, the study staff will collect and review the subject's diary as well as any unused study medication. The subject will be asked about any changes in medications and/ or medical conditions since their last contact with the site. The subject will also be asked about any unusual symptoms, or out of the ordinary experiences since their last contact with the site. The subject will be asked to report how they felt they responded to the study medication. The subject's vital signs will be measured and a blood sample (2 teaspoons) will be obtained from a vein in their arm."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cluster Headache"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":15,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Depacon IV and Depakote ER","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects will be treated in this single arm study with 2 consecutive days of IV Depacon followed by oral Depakote ER for a total of 1000 mg of Depacon and 1000 mg of Depakote ER each day.","interventionNames":["Drug: Depacon IV and Depakote ER"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Depacon IV and Depakote ER","armGroupLabels":["Depacon IV and Depakote ER"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Time Required to Achieve a Greater Than or Equal to 50% Reduction in Frequency or Severity of Individual Cluster Attacks Compared to Subject-reported Baseline.","description":"Severity: measured on an 11 point scale, where 0 = no pain and 10= excruciating pain.

Three main structures are involved: the trigeminovascular system, the cephalic afferents of the autonomic nervous system, and centrally the hypothalamus. There are many clinical arguments in favor of the involvement of the hypothalamus in CH. In addition, several radiological studies have confirmed the involvement of the posterior hypothalamic region in cluster attacks. Thus, a positron emission tomography study showed hyperactivity of the posteroinferior nucleus of the ipsilateral hypothalamus. Voxel based MRI studies have shown a bilateral increase in the volume of the inferoposterior part of the homolateral hypothalamus. The involvement of the posterior hypothalamic region or more precisely the ventral tegmental area of the midbrain therefore seems acquired, although its real role as a generator or modulator of pain remains to be precised.\n\nDeep brain stimulation (dBS) is used in the management of chronic drug-resistant CH with an overall efficacy in 2/3 of patients. Nevertheless, its mechanism of action remains poorly understood, thus limiting the selection of patients and the optimization of care. The lack of clear neurophysiological criteria to identify the neuronal population to be targeted is a major source of uncertainty in the positioning of dBS electrodes and parameters adjustment. In order to improve the understanding and at the same time the results of this technique, obtaining in vivo electrophysiological data seems mandatory. Local fields potentials (LFP) have been recordered by in vivo by dBS in other diseases (Parkinson's disease, tremor…) and their analysis has brought new insigights in the characterization and understanding of these pathology. New generations of neurostimulator (Percept Medtronic) enables continuous recording of LFP in implanted patients. The goal of our study is the recording of LFP at the time of CH attacks via the BrainSenseTM system. This system included in the stimulator allows in vivo collection of LFP in the absence and presence of stimulation. The pathophysiological data recordered will then be correlated with the clinical benefit of the dBS ( nulber of attacks, duration, pain intensity…). As it is a feasibility study, only 5 patients will be included."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cluster Headache","Trigeminal Autonomic Cephalgia"],"keywords":["Hypothalamus","Local Fields Potentials"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":5,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Local Field potential recording","description":"Continuous recording of Local Field potentials in patients implanted with Deep brain stimulation"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Local field potentials","description":"Local field potentials amplitudes registered by the patient during a cluster attack","timeFrame":"Between 0 to 12 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Efficacy of deep brain stimulation on attacks frequency","description":"Frequency of cluster attacks","timeFrame":"Between 0 to 12 months"},{"measure":"Change in Efficacy of deep brain stimulation on pain intensity","description":"Pain intensity of cluster attacks","timeFrame":"Between 0 to 12 months"},{"measure":"Change Efficacy of deep brain stimulation in attacks duration","description":"Duration of cluster attacks","timeFrame":"Between 0 to 12 months"},{"measure":"Change in Efficacy of deep brain stimulation on treatment","description":"Medical treatments for cluster headache","timeFrame":"Between 0 to 12 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Adult patients (age : 18-70 years-old) suffering from refractory chronic cluster headache\n* Patients eligible for a deep brain stimulation in the ventral tegmental area of the mesencephalon\n* Patients implanted with a deep brain stimulation system PerceptTM Medtronic®\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Secondary cluster headache\n* Patients implanted with another device of deep brain stimulation","sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"70 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients suffering from refractry chronic cluster headache","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Anne BALOSSIER, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"0491384277","phoneExt":"+33","email":"anne.balossier@ap-hm.fr"},{"name":"Emilie GARRIDO-PRADALIE","role":"CONTACT","phone":"0491382061","phoneExt":"+33","email":"Emilie.GARRIDO-PRADALIE@ap-hm.fr"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Marseille","city":"Marseille","country":"France","contacts":[{"name":"Anne BALOSSIER, MD","role":"CONTACT"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":43.29695,"lon":5.38107}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"UNDECIDED"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2025-10-02"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D003027","term":"Cluster Headache"},{"id":"D051303","term":"Trigeminal Autonomic Cephalalgias"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D051270","term":"Headache Disorders, Primary"},{"id":"D020773","term":"Headache Disorders"},{"id":"D001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false},

Although the latter compounds have shown some efficacy in reducing the attack frequency, the evidence for their effect is weak. All current prophylactics are prescribed off-label and are limited in their utility due to associated side effects. Despite treatment, many (notably chronic) cluster headache patients continue suffering headache attacks.\n\nInvasive, expensive treatments like hypothalamic deep brain stimulation, occipital nerve stimulation and sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation are last resort options. Recently, a monoclonal antibody targeting calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) received FDA approval for episodic cluster headache, but was shown to be ineffective in cCH. Thus, there is a considerable unmet need for effective treatments that are better tolerated, safe and affordable.\n\nIn this study, the investigators will assess the efficacy of prophylactic treatment with LSD in cCH. The evidence for the efficacy of LSD is limited, with the majority of data originating from case reports or uncontrolled and retrospective (internet) surveys. Nevertheless, these studies do provide indications that LSD may hold potential as a cluster headache prophylaxis.\n\nThe primary objective of this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial is to compare the efficacy of LSD 25μg every 3 days for 3 weeks versus placebo in cCH. The investigators aim to show that, at the end of treatment, verum is more efficacious than placebo with comparable tolerability in an ambulatory setting. To explore the sustainability of benefit the investigators will also assess the (sustained) response at 5 weeks post-treatment (8 weeks postrandomization).\n\nIf the study findings are positive, LSD should be further studied before use in routine clinical practice. Non-hallucinogenic low-dosed LSD may provide an alternative or adjunctive option for patients who do not respond to or cannot tolerate currently available treatments."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Cluster Headache"],"keywords":["Chronic cluster headache","Lysergic acid

This could help reduce the brain's sensitivity to pain over time.\n\nStimulating another nerve group, called the V1 branch of the Trigeminal nerves (around the forehead and eye), can also help by interrupting pain signals and possibly stopping an attack or making it less severe and less frequent.\n\nWhen both nerve areas-the Trigeminal and Occipital nerves-are stimulated together, it may have a stronger effect on reducing pain and how often headaches happen. Some early reports in a few patients have shown promising results with this combined treatment.\n\nThe PRIMUS system is a small device that can be implanted under the skin.

However, the tendency of cluster headache attacks to occur during sleep suggests a pivotal role of the hypothalamus, a brain structure that regulates essential body functions such as sleep and the biological clock.\n\nLow sodium oxybate (LXB) is a naturally occurring neurotransmitter and a psychoactive substance that deepens sleep by increasing slow wave sleep and reducing Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The chemical name of oxybate is gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB). The mechanism of action of LXB is still unknown. It is hypothesized that the therapeutic effects are mediated through GABA-B actions during sleep at noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurons, as well as at thalamocortical neurons.\n\nWe hypothesize that cluster headache attacks occur in relation to specific characteristics and time-points of the sleep microstructure and expect that a sleep-deepening treatment with LXB will reduce nocturnal attack-frequency and thereby improve sleep and quality of life.\n\nThe main objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LXB in the treatment of nocturnal cluster headache attacks in subjects with chronic cluster headache.\n\nThe main trial endpoint is the change from baseline in average weekly frequency of nocturnal cluster headache attacks over 4-week fixed stable dose of treatment period. Nocturnal attacks are defined as occurring after sleep onset during the night until morning awakening between 22:00 and 07:00.\n\nSecondary endpoints include change from baseline in weekly frequency of cluster headache attacks in a 24-hr period (both nocturnal and day-time attacks) over 4-week fixed stable dose of treatment period. Additionally, the i) percentage of participants with a ≥50% reduction from baseline in the weekly number of nocturnal cluster headache attacks, ii) percentage of participants with a ≥50% reduction from baseline in the weekly number of cluster headache attacks in a 24-hr period (both nocturnal and day-time attacks) and iii) cluster headache attack pain intensity will be assessed over the 4-week fixed stable dose of treatment period, iv) Mean change in weekly number of times an abortive medication was taken v) number of patients with improvement in Patient Global Impressions Scale (PGIc) and Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGIc) vi) improvement of sleep quality, sleep onset, sleep maintenance and sleep efficiency by diary.

Typically, attacks' onset displays a circadian rhythm, and bout recurrence happens in a circannual fashion. Notably, the mechanisms underlying the shift between the remission phase and cluster bout are poorly understood.\n\nThus, the investigators aim to study brain connectivity in episodic cluster headache patients. Additionally, an explorative analysis of functional connectivity in chronic cluster headache patients will be performed.","detailedDescription":"Electroencephalogram (EEG) is widely available as a powerful mean to non-invasively study brain connectivity. High density EEG (HD-EEG), enables to record electrical brain activity with high temporal and spatial resolution. Through the analysis of brain oscillations across different frequency bands (from alpha to delta), it can evaluate sensory, pain processing and information integration, thus detecting potential markers or predictors for therapeutic interventions.\n\nPrevious neurophysiological studies focused on EEG and to assess functional connectivity or spectral analysis in migraine patients, with no data in cluster headache. Conventional studies found higher slow wave activity (predominantly theta) in the inter-ictal phase and higher excitability in the visual cortex during visual aura.\n\nIn 2016 a resting state study showed a predominance of low frequency bands in the ictal phase. The interictal and ictal phases patients also presented a diffuse lower coherence, suggesting low functional connectivity. Furthermore, an altered spatial connectivity for lower alpha-band activities was found in the interictal phases during sensory stimulation by means of HD-EEG, suggesting a thalamocortical dysrhythmia.\n\nThe primary aim of the study is to evaluate changes in functional connectivity in episodic cluster headache patients, comparing the active phase with the remission phase. Additionally, an explorative analysis of functional connectivity in chronic cluster headache patients will be performed.\n\nStudy design:\n\nEpisodic cluster headache patients (eCH) will be evaluated in two separate timepoints: during the active phase (T0), defined as at least one week of active bout, and in remission phase (T1), defined as at leat 14 days without headache and without any ongoing preventive medication. During each visit, clinical data will be collected, and an HD-EEG will be performed.\n\nChronic cluster headache patients (cCH) will be evaluated in a single timepoint, and healthy controls will undergo HD-EEG registration once.\n\nHD-EEG registration:\n\nParticipants will perform 4 recordings (6 minutes each) in resting-state condition, 2 with opened eyes, and 2 with closed eyes, in a randomized order.\n\nThe investigators will analyze the resting state FC among six resting state networks (Default mode network, Dorsal attention network, Ventral attention network, Language network , Somatomotor network and Visual network) in the following frequency bands: alfa 8-12 Hz, beta 13-30 Hz, gamma 31-80 Hz, theta 4-7 Hz. delta 1-3 Hz.\n\nAcquisition parameters will be: High-Pass: 0.5 Hz; Low-Pass: 100 Hz; Notch: 50 Hz. For analysis of HD-EEG data, a tailored analysis pipe-line that was previously developed and validated to reconstruct neural sources from cortical/subcortical gray matter will be performed. EEG signals will be band-pass filtered (1-80 Hz) and down-sampled at 250 Hz. Biological artifacts will be rejected using Independent Component Analysis (ICA). EEG signals will be referenced with a customized version of the Reference Electrode Standardization Technique (REST). A matrix will estimate the relationship between the measured scalp potentials and the dipoles corresponding to brain sources. Sources reconstruction will be performed with the exact low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA) algorithm\n\nStatistical plan:\n\nThe sample size was computed with the freeware online platform www.openepi.com. As there are no previous studies on HD-EEG functional connectivity in cluster headache, our sample size analysis was based on the work of Bjork (Bjork et al., 2009). A difference between groups in the theta relative power band equal to 0.04 (±0.04) will be considered as clinically meaningful. Considering a two-tailed t-test for the comparison with confidence interval 95%; power: 80%, the minimum suggested sample size was 20 subjects for group.\n\nA preliminary normality analysis will be performed to decide whether to use parametric or non-parametric methods, through Shapiro Wilk test.\n\nNumerical variables will be described as mean and standard deviation (or median and quartiles if appropriate), categorical variables as raw numbers and percentages.\n\nFunctional connectivity analyses will be conducted for separate bands and eyes closed

When a specific brain region becomes more active, it requires more oxygen, which fMRI can detect. This will help determine whether the intervention alters brain function, such as increased activation in areas involved in movement, memory, or pain processing.

CH can be categorized into episodic cluster headache (ECH), chronic cluster headache (CCH), and probable CH. Intervention for CH requires a multifaceted and early approach and varies due to the heterogeneity of patients, which makes it difficult to formulate appropriate treatment plan, and the minimally invasive interventional therapy between drug and surgical treatment is still worth looking forward to.\n\nThe pterygopalatine ganglion, also known as SPG, is a essential proportion in activation of cortical structures and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of CH attacks, which makes it the potential therapeutic target in drug-resistant CH. Percutaneous pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) at SPG is a minimally destructive treatment which shows efficacy, safety, and repeatedly efficacy for refractory CH. PRF is a reliable alternative with few neurological side effects and complications for patients who have not responded to conservative treatment. However, the long term pain relieve is not satisfying. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is an autologous blood-derived product of 3 times concentrated platelet above average levels, which contains many growth factors, cytokines, chemokine, and cell-adhesion molecules, therefore function in the activation and synthesis of healing process, tissue proliferation and regeneration. Researches by Michno etc. and Giaccari etc. have proved that PRP combined with PRF therapy may provide more effective outcome than PRF alone in treatment of neuralgia, but whether the combined therapy can improve the efficacy of CH treatment is not clear. ECH occurs in 90% of the CH patients. The investigators assume that PRP combined with PRF acting on SPG might have better therapeutic effect on ECH than PRF alone, by giving combined treatment or PRF therapy alone according to patients willingness, the investigators plan on conducting this prospective trail to compare the clinical efficacy and safety of PRP combined with PRF versus PRF alone."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cluster Headache","Pain Management","Episodic Cluster Headache"],"keywords":["Episodic Cluster Headache","Pain management","Pulsed Radiofrequency","Platlet-rich Plasma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":242,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Pulse Radiofrequency combined with Platelet Rich Plasma","description":"The pulse treatment generator will be set to the automatic pulsed radiofrequency mode, with a temperature of 42°C, pulse frequency of 2Hz, pulse width of 20ms and treatment duration of 360s.

It is followed by millions of people around the word as a life-style, but in the last years was proposed as a treatment for the epilepsy, by its capacity to induce the state of ketosis.\n\nSince Authors observed that ketosis could be also useful in migraine, and migraine shares some pathophysiological features with cluster headache, The aim of the study is to test the efficacy of Atkins diet in Cluster Headache by an open label one harm observational study.","detailedDescription":"The Atkins diet is a ketogenic high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet for long adopted as lifestyle by people that dislike have an high carbohydrate intake. This nutritional life style seems to account for more energy in the daily activity and an easy weight control. In the last years, researchers showed that a modified Atkins diet (MAD) can be useful to treat drug resistant epilepsy, maybe by the induction of ketogenesis.\n\nKetogenesis, ketone-body formation, is a physiologic phenomenon also observed in patients following low-carbohydrate high fat diets. Different Authors evidenced a protective effect of ketone bodies also on migraine that shares some pathophysiological features with cluster headache (CH).\n\nCH is the worst form of headache, also called as \"suicide headache\"; in particular its unremitting form, called Chronic CH (CCH) is regarded as a clinical challenge for neurologist, if refractory to pharmacological treatments. So far, no data are available about a beneficial effect of ketogenesis in CH. However, the beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) has a chemical formula similar to gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB) that has shown to be effective in CH. Moreover, ketosis has also a beneficial effect on hypothalamic dysfunctions that are shared by some form of epilepsy and CH.\n\nAim of this study is verify in an open label observational study if a MAD can be useful in the treatment of CCH. In case of positive outcome, the results could be used as preliminary data to design a double blind versus placebo study, to asses definitively if ketogenesis is really able to prevent/avoid headache attacks in CH.\n\nMethods: By the Italian branch of the Organization for the Understanding of Cluster Headache (OUCH), there will be recruited CCH volunteers that accept to modify their diet according to Atkins Diet for at least three months.\n\nHeadache attack frequency will be collected on specific headache-calendars and a comparison between the pre-diet phase and the during-the-diet- phase will be performed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Cluster Headache"],"keywords":["Ketogenic Diet"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Case series","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":18,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Modified Atkins Diet (MAD)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"CCH patients that follows at least 3 months of MAD","interventionNames":["Other: Atkins diet"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Atkins diet","description":"A nutritional regimen characterized by high fat low carbohydrate intake.","armGroupLabels":["Modified Atkins Diet (MAD)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Attack frequency","description":"Reduction of at least 50% of number of attacks per month","timeFrame":"3 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Diagnosis of CCH (less than 30 consecutive days of attacks remission in the last year)\n* kept a headache diary for at least 1 month\n* CH onset before the age of 50\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* over consumption of acute pain-killers (triptan, analgesic, or ergotamine)\n* pregnancy or lactation\n* type I diabetes\n* serious organic or psychiatric disorders that the investigators judged as having the potential to influence the trial evaluation.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Francesco Pierelli, MD","affiliation":"Sapienza Univeristy","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Policlinico Umberto I","city":"Rome","zip":"00161","country":"Italy","geoPoint":{"lat":41.89193,"lon":12.51133}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"28132289","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Di Lorenzo C, Coppola G, Sirianni G, Rossi P, Pierelli F.

This disease can have devastating consequences due to the pain intensity (it is also called \"suicide headache\"), to the side effects of the drug preventive therapies, and to the resistance of some subtypes of the headache to all existing medications.\n\nRecent studies suggest that cluster headache could be associated with a decrease of the activity of frontal areas involved in descending pain control, in particular the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex. The aim of this pilot study is to activate these areas with a non-invasive neurostimulation technique, called transcranial direct current stimulation, as a preventive treatment for cluster headache sufferers.","detailedDescription":"Cluster headache affects 0.1%-0.25% of the general population, but its prevalence may be underestimated. It is a primary headache disorder with a higher prevalence in young males, characterized by attacks of severe unilateral periorbital/temporal pain with autonomic symptoms (ie lacrimation, nasal congestion, eyelid edema, Horner's…) and agitation, lasting 15 to 180 minutes and occurring periodically in bouts (clusters) in about 90% of patients (episodic cluster headache or ECH, ICHD-III criteria 3.1.1).In 10% of patients there is no sustained spontaneous remission for long periods, which defines chronic cluster headache (CCH, ICHD-III criteria 3.1.2).\n\nThe pathophysiology of cluster headache is not completely understood, but neuroimaging studies clearly suggest that activation of the ipsilateral postero-ventral hypothalamus plays a seminal role during the attack. Recent findings suggest that prefrontal areas may be dysfunctioning in cluster headache patients. The investigator shave shown in CCH patients that the beneficial effects of ONS are associated with activation of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, an area responsible for descending pain-control. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) allows activating the underlying cortex and connected subcortical structures under the anode or inhibiting them under the cathode. tDCS was used as a therapeutic strategy in various neurological disorders, chronic pain disorders and depression. Because of its non-invasiveness, It is of particular interest in primary headaches where various brain areas are known to function abnormally even between headache attacks. It has been tested in migraine but not in cluster headache.\n\nIn a recent study, the investigators have shown that anodal tDCS over the visual cortex is able to modify visual evoked potentials in healthy volunteers and migraineurs, and after a 2-month treatment of 2 weekly sessions to significantly decrease attack frequency in episodic migraine.\n\nCCH patients will have to apply the neurostimulation outside of an attack every day for 20 minutes during 4 to 8 weeks.\n\nAdherence to the treatment will be evaluated by monitoring the time during which the device is switched on via an in-built software."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Cluster Headache"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":32,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cefaly tDCS","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Sponge-electrodes (5 x 7 cm) will be postioned at Fz (anode) and over the spinous process of C7 (cathode).

The 1-year prevalence of CH is about 0.1 %, the male: female ratio is 3:1. The majority of patients have cluster periods of weeks to months with frequent attacks which are alternated with symptom-free periods of months to several years; the episodic from of CH. In about 10% of patients the CH is chronic (CCH) in which either no remission occurs within 1 year or the remissions last less than 1 month. At least 10 % of CCH patients are refractory to medical treatment or cannot tolerate the treatments.\n\nRecent pilot studies suggest that occipital nerve stimulation (ONS) in medically intractable CCH (MICCH) might offer an effective alternative to medical treatment. There are no randomised clinical trials and a placebo effect cannot be excluded. Long term tolerability is known from other indications.\n\nHere the investigators propose a prospective, randomised, double blind, parallel group multi-centre international clinical study to compare the reduction in attack frequency from baseline of occipital nerve stimulation (ONS) in patients with MICCH between two different stimulation conditions: high (100%) and low (30%) stimulation.\n\nFollowing implantation there will first be a run-in phase of 10 days of 10% stimulation intensity, followed by a stepwise monthly increase up to either 30% or 100%. Patients will be assessed monthly by a blinded assessor. The primary outcome measure is the mean number of attacks over the last 4 weeks of the double blind 6 month treatment period in the 100% versus the 30% treatment group. Hereafter, in an open extension phase of 6 months, all patients will receive 100% stimulation or the stimulation considered optimal by the patient.\n\nSecondary outcome measures include the rate of responders (≥ 50% reduction in attack frequency during the last 4 weeks of each treatment period), patient's satisfaction, medication use, quality of life, mean pain intensity, economic evaluation and whether patients would recommend the treatment to another patient. The investigators will also investigate whether predictive factors can be identified for efficacy.","detailedDescription":"Trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TACs) are characterized by frequent, short-lasting attacks of unilateral extremely severe headaches accompanied by ipsilateral facial autonomic features and are the most severe of the primary headache disorders. TACs include cluster headache (CH), paroxysmal hemicrania (PH) and short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT). CH is the most common form of TAC. The 1-year prevalence is about 1 in 1000, with the vast majority of patients having episodic CH (ECH): periods of weeks to months with frequent attacks which are alternated with symptom-free periods of several months to years. About 10% have chronic CH (CCH): attack free periods of less than one month in every 12 months, unless treatment is given. The chronic form can be primary unremitting from onset, or can be secondary, transform from the episodic form. CCH may spontaneously become episodic.\n\nEffective acute treatments for CH attacks are injectable or intranasal triptans and oxygen inhalation. Steroids (only for a short period), verapamil, lithium carbonate and methysergide are the most effective preventive therapies. At least 10% of patients with CCH is or may become refractory to or cannot tolerate medical therapy. For patients with medically intractable CCH (MICCH) there is no common treatment. Different experimental treatments, such as deep brain stimulation (DBS), radiofrequency lesions, glycerol injections, gamma knife, and surgery or root section of the trigeminal nerve are either substantially ineffective, or have significant short-comings with serious complications such as death or neurological deficits such as anaesthesia dolorosa or lack of efficacy.\n\nCH has considerable impact on socio-economic and personal functions due to direct costs of healthcare services and indirect costs of lost work days and decreased work efficacy. Higher pain scores and a higher percentage of patients with poor health due to pain and social functioning are found among CH patients compared with patients suffering from migraine. The impact on social functions, quality of life and use of healthcare of patients with MICCH is most likely even larger, although precise figures are not available. In the study of Burns et al. patients, suffering from MICCH, had on average over four attacks per day. Attacks of CH have been described by patients as being worse than child birth. Recently treatment of headache was listed as one of the top priorities of US National the Institute of Medicine's agenda for comparative-effectiveness research.\n\nFunctional imaging studies in CH identified activations in the region of the posterior hypothalamus, which led to the use of neurostimulation therapy in MICCH. Hypothalamic DBS was shown to be effective in some patients with MICCH but unfortunately this treatment is associated with a high risk of (even lethal) consequences.\n\nStructures in the occipital region of the head are mainly innervated by the greater occipital nerve that is a branch of the C2 spinal root. Convergence of cervical, somatic trigeminal and dural trigeminovascular afferents on second order nociceptors in the brain stem is well documented. Stimulation of the greater occipital nerve increased metabolic activity in cervical regions of the spinal cord and in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis in the cat. In humans an occipital nerve blockade decreased the ipsi- and contralateral R2 response, confirming the anatomic and functional convergence of afferent cervical and trigeminal pathways. These studies suggest that modulation of these pathways may influence headache.\n\nSuboccipital injection of corticosteroid with local anaesthetics was shown to be effective in a placebo-controlled trial. In this study 4 patients suffering from CCH were included. In all patients the attacks recurred eventually. The authors suggest that suboccipital steroid injections ought to be tried as a single shot treatment before invasive treatments are considered such as DBS, but in later studies this turned out to be of no predictive value of the response to neuromodulation therapies.\n\nAlong the same line, stimulation of the greater occipital nerve (ONS) has been tried with some success in intractable headaches including CCH. Burns et al. described 14 patients suffering from MICCH and were treated with ONS in an open retrospective study. Ten patients improved; three improved by 90% or more, 3 by 40%-90% and 4 by 20-30%. In a prospective open ONS study on MICCH patients Magis et al. showed a reduction in attack frequency of 79.9%. No serious complications were described in both studies."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Cluster Headache"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":130,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"100% occipital nerve stimulation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Stimulation frequency and pulse width will be uniformly held constant at 60 Hz and pulse width at 450 ms.

Subjects will then be randomized to into either two groups. The first group is continuing with standard of care and the second group is treatment with the investigational device (GammaCore) for a period of 4 weeks. After this 4 week period, all subjects will treat with the GammaCore for another 4 week period. It is hypothesized the the treatment group will have a reduction in mean cluster headaches per week by 50% compared to the standard of care group.","detailedDescription":"The study is a prospective randomized controlled multi-center investigation designed for comparison of two parallel groups, GammaCore® (active treatment) and Standard of Care, SoC, (control). The study period begins with a 2 week run-in period, followed by a 4 week comparative period when the subjects are randomized to either active treatment or control 1:1. The comparative period will be followed by a period where all subject will receive GammaCore® for 4 weeks.After the subject signed the Consent Form for participation the baseline (visit1) data will be collected. Subject will be informed how to complete the 2 week diary during the run-in period During the run-in period, all subjects will use stable SoC according to their individual prescriptions. The subject will record as CH attack regarding duration and frequency and the use of medication and oxygen.\n\nOnce subjects have finalized the run-in period, they are randomized to continue in 4 weeks comparative period. During this period, the control group continues with stable SoC and the active group is provided with a GammaCore® device for prophylactic and acute treatment in addition to the stable SoC Subjects stimulate 3 x 2 times daily as part of the prophylactic treatment regimen (cervical vagal nerve). Three 90 second stimulations are self-administered by the subject with 5 minutes between each stimulation on the right side of the neck.\n\nThis preventive stimulation regimen is performed:\n\n* First Daily Treatment - within 1 hour of waking\n* Second Daily Treatment - 7-10 hours following the first daily treatment\n\nAcute CH attack:\n\n* 3 x 90 second treatments consecutively at the onset of pain or symptoms. If the attack is not aborted within 15 minutes the subject should be informed to take SOC abortive medication.\n* If an acute cluster headache attack is treated with the GammaCore® device, the subject will try to work within the preventive treatment window to avoid a preventive treatment in the 2-hour refractory period following the acute treatment.\n\nA total of minimally 6 stimulations for the preventive part and as needed for the acute attacks. The active group also continues with the stable SoC during the entire 4 weeks period. Both groups record all CH attacks in the diary together with medication and oxygen use. All adverse events shall also be recorded in the diary.\n\nThe end of the 4 week comparative period marks the completion of the randomized part of the study, however all subjects are provided the option to continue to a 4 week GammaCore® treatment with the same stimulation parameter as during the 4 week randomization period. All subjects randomized to the SoC group will receive training.\n\nDuring the entire study period, subjects are allowed to take rescue medication including oxygen inhalation for abortion of CH attacks. The amount and doses of the medication and oxygen are recorded in the diary."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Chronic Cluster Headache"],"keywords":["vagus nerve stimulation","vagal nerve stimulation","nVNS","VNS","cluster headache","chronic","non invasive","gammacore"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":97,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Standard of care","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"No intervention, standard of care"},{"label":"GammaCore","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Three stimulation treatments 2x/day 7 to 10 hours apart from one another.

The pathophysiology behind the condition is largely unknown, but increasing evidence indicate that the hypothalamus plays a pivotal role. The headache attacks come in clusters or bouts (hence the name) which last up to three months, after which the headache disappears for at least one month. 10-15% have chronic cluster headache. During attacks, the patients have cranial sympathetic hypoactivity and parasympathetic hyperactivity, whereas they have cranial parasympathetic hypoactivity during remission phase. There is an emerging hypothesis that headache attacks are elicited in a state of autonomic hypoarousability, which is also supported by the fact that most cluster attacks occur during the night, when the patients are sleeping.\n\nThe aim in this project is to study the intercept between the sleep-wake cycle, autonomic tone and the occurrence of headache attacks, by using actigraphy, heart-rate variability and pupillometry. All these methods are well validated, and frequently used in studies on sleep and autonomic function. The study design is that of a case-control model where 15 cluster headache patients will undergo pupillometry, before wearing the actigraph and heart-rate variability-monitor for two weeks, once in cluster bout and once in remission phase. The actigraphy will register nocturnal movement and sleep quality, and headache attacks will be registered by pressing a button on the actigraph. The pupillometry measures pupillary constriction and dilation in response to light, a reflex that is controlled by the autonomic nervous system. The heart-rate variability monitors fluctuations in the heart rate which reflects the sympathovagal balance of cardiac control. All participants will fill out the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index before and after registration. In addition, 15 healthy controls will undergo one session of the same examinations. The results of the study will give valuable insight to the pathophysiology of a condition that is very painful and has great impact on the patients' quality of life, and also add knowledge to the relation between headache, sleep and the autonomic nervous system.","detailedDescription":"Cluster headache (CH) is a primary headache in which recurring episodes of unilateral, periorbital pain is accompanied by unilateral autonomic symptoms such as tearing, conjunctival injection, nasal congestion or rhinorrhea, miosis and ptosis. Headache attacks last from 15 to 180 minutes, and patients may have up to eight attacks each day. Most attacks occur at night between midnight and 04 a.m. Headache attacks come in recurring bouts lasting up to three months, after which the headache disappears for at least one month. 10-15% of patients have chronic cluster headache, meaning that there are no pauses between bouts. The condition has a prevalence of about 0.2% and affects men 3-4 times more often than women.\n\nThe combination of unilateral headache and autonomic symptoms makes CH an interesting disorder to study in view of headache pathophysiology. Increasing amounts of evidence points at the hypothalamus as the locus in quo for CH pathophysiology. During attacks, the autonomic symptoms seem to be caused both by a hypofunction of sympathetic activity (miosis and ptosis), and a hyperfunction of parasympathetic activity (conjunctival injection, tearing and nasal congestion). Physiological studies seem to imply that patients during bouts have an upregulated parasympathetic activity caused by activation of the trigemino-parasympathetic reflex and a downregulated sympathetic tone, while they outside of bouts have a downregulated parasympathetic tone. Studying the autonomous nervous system in cluster headache patients is difficult, as they usually have headaches only a few months during the year and the attacks are quite short lasting, but excruciating painful when they occur, leaving the patients restless and with an urge to move about. This makes it difficult to study what actually happens during the painful phase. Thus, finding new ways to study the autonomic nervous system in these patients during the various stages of their disease is very important.\n\nIn addition to autonomic dysfunction, sleep disturbances are frequent and well documented in CH patients. Sleep is often problematic in all headaches, but CH patients seem to have a high prevalence of insomnia even when compared to other headache populations. This is not merely a result of the recurring nocturnal headaches, as CH patients have significantly reduced sleep quality compared to controls even one year after last headache attack. The documentation mostly consist of studies using well validated questionnaires such as the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) or diagnostic criteria such as the DSM IV. Only one major study have assessed sleep quality in cluster headache using quantitative methods such as polysomnography. In this study, the authors found that cluster headache patients in headache bout had a reduced percentage of REM sleep, longer REM latency and fewer arousals compared to healthy controls. There was no temporal relationship between headache attacks and specific sleep stages. Sleep is the single most important trigger for attacks in cluster headache, and most attacks occur during the late night or early morning hours.\n\nWe know that the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic tone differ between REM and NREM-sleep stages in healthy individuals, and that there is a transient decrease in sympathetic tone during the night, which is reflected in a period of reduced heart rate and blood pressure. This \"dipping\" coincides with the increased occurrence of cluster attacks, and fits well into the emerging theory that cluster headache attacks is elicited in a state of hypoarousability, or reduced sympathetic tone. Thus, sleep disturbances are, together with autonomic dysfunction, an integral part of CH pathophysiology, and further studies are needed to elucidate the association between sleep, autonomic dysfunction and headache attacks.\n\nThe aim of this study is to assess sleep quality and autonomic tone in CH patients inside and outside of headache bouts, compared to healthy controls. Inside of bouts, the investigators will assess how the occurrence of headache attacks are related to autonomic tone. The data will be gathered by using actigraphy, pupillometry and heart-rate variability, all well validated research tools. In addition, all participators will fill out the PSQI reporting subjective sleep quality.\n\nPupillometry: The pupillary response to light is conducted by the autonomous nervous system. In short, constriction of the pupil is a parasympathetic response, and pupillary redilation a sympathetic response. By measuring the velocity of constricting and dilating the pupil, you get a good view of the balance between the two. The measurements are made in 1 lux ambient darkness with a pupillometer that consists of a infra-red camera that films the pupil as it responds to a small light flash, and measures the time the pupil takes to contract and redilate again.\n\nHeart-rate variability: Heart-rate variability (HRV) is an indirect, non-invasive way of measuring the autonomic nervous system activity, with contributions from both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Frequency-specific fluctuations in the heart rate are assessed with power spectrum analysis. The high frequency component (HF: 0.15-0.4 Hz) reflects vagal control, whereas the low frequency component (LF: 0.04-0.15) reflects sympathetic control. The LF/HF ratio reflects sympathovagal balance. Reduced Heart-rate variability has been associated to increased mortality in patients with myocardial infarction and heart failure. A simple computer placed on the forearm combined with a monitor placed on the chest, giving minimal discomfort to the patient, may now measure heart rate variability.\n\nActigraphy: Polysomnography is the gold standard of sleep assessment, but is quite an extensive and resource intensive method. In later years, new technology has made actigraphy a reliable and easy way to measure sleep in a less invasive manner. An actigraph is a small, wrist-watch-sized device that monitors movement by using an accelerometer that tracks motion and creates a graph. In addition, a button can be pushed to mark events such as bedtime or waketime. Actigraphs are widely used to study sleep-wake cycles and circadian rhythms. Several studies have compared actigraphy to polysomnography in the assessment of e.g. insomnia and other sleep disturbances, and found it to be a valid and cost-effective alternative.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index: There are several self-report questionnaires available measuring subjective sleep quality, and the Pittsburgh sleep quality index is one of the best validated and widely used alternatives. PSQI measures retrospective subjective sleep quality and disturbances during the last month.\n\nThe study will be conducted as a case-control study, comparing patients to healthy controls, but it will also compare patients to themselves in and out of headache bouts. The patients will undergo pupillometry, actigraphy and HRV registration twice: once in remission phase, and once in headache phase. Pupillometry will be conducted at the out-patient clinic. Here, the participants will also receive their actigraph and HRV-monitor. Each registration will last two weeks, where the actigraph, formed as a watch, is placed on the patient's wrist for recording of movement during day and night, and a heart rate monitor formed as a belt records heart rate variability. Software is available to interpret the data making it possible to measure sleep and vasoactive tone. After the two weeks are over, the patients will fill out the PSQI, reporting the subjective sleep quality, which may be compared to the registrations from the actigraph. To register in headache phase, the patients must be willing to contact the study researchers and give notice when the bout has begun, so that they may come and receive the actigraph. The patients will be asked to mark the occurrence of attacks during the registration by pressing a button on the actigraph.\n\nThe healthy controls will undergo pupillometry, actigraphy and HRV monitoring only once, and fill out the PSQI after registration. The PSQI also registers the use of sleeping pills, which may be used in both patients and controls. For each two weeks registration, the average number of hours with daylight will be noted, as this may influence the sleep quality of the patients. These data will be given from the Norwegian Meteorological Institute."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cluster Headache","Sleep"],"keywords":["Cluster headache","Actigraphy","Pupillometry"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patient","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Cluster headache patients are examined with light reflex pupillometry, two weeks actigraphy and heart-rate variability monitoring both in headache phase and remission phase.","interventionNames":["Device: Actigraphy","Device: Heart-rate variability monitoring","Device: Pupillometry"]},{"label":"Controls","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Healthy controls undergo the same examinations once: light reflex pupillometry, actigraphy and heart-rate variability monitoring.","interventionNames":["Device: Actigraphy","Device: Heart-rate variability monitoring","Device: Pupillometry"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Actigraphy","description":"A small computer in the shape of a wristwatch, that registers movement and assesses sleep quality.","armGroupLabels":["Controls","Patient"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Heart-rate variability monitoring","description":"A small computer that registers variation in heart rate, which reflects cardiac autonomic tone.","armGroupLabels":["Controls","Patient"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Pupillometry","description":"A handheld infrared camera that sends out a light flash and records the pupil as it contracts and dilates, as a measure of pupillary autonomic tone.","armGroupLabels":["Controls","Patient"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in pupillary average contraction velocity","description":"The velocity of pupillary constriction in response to light, measured with a pupillometer, in mm/sec","timeFrame":"Once in the beginning of a headache phase, and once 4 weeks after last headache attack"},{"measure":"Change in total sleep time","description":"Average number of hours asleep per night, measured over two weeks with an actigraph","timeFrame":"Measured for two weeks during headache phase, and again four weeks after last headache attack"},{"measure":"Change in sleep efficiency","description":"Average number of hours asleep per night divided by time spent in bed, measured over two weeks with an actigraph","timeFrame":"Measured for two weeks during headache phase, and again four weeks after last headache attack"},{"measure":"Change in wake after sleep onset","description":"Average number of awakenings during the sleep phase, measured over two weeks with an actigraph","timeFrame":"Measured for two weeks during headache phase, and again four weeks after last headache attack"},{"measure":"Change in LF/HF ratio","description":"The ratio of low-frequency and high-frequency fluctuations in heart rate, measured over two weeks with a heart-rate variability monitor","timeFrame":"Measured for two weeks during headache phase, and again four weeks after last headache attack"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Episodic or chronic cluster headache, according to the ICHD-IIIb criteria.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Cardiac arrythmia or known autonomic dysfunction.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Karl B Alstadhaug, MD, PhD","affiliation":"Nordlandssykehuset HF","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Nordland Hospital Trust","city":"Bodø","state":"Nordland","zip":"8003","country":"Norway","geoPoint":{"lat":67.28267,"lon":14.37513}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2025-10-02"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D003027","term":"Cluster Headache"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D051303","term":"Trigeminal Autonomic Cephalalgias"},{"id":"D051270","term":"Headache Disorders, Primary"},{"id":"D020773","term":"Headache Disorders"},{"id":"D001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D056044","term":"Actigraphy"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D008991","term":"Monitoring, Physiologic"},{"id":"D019937","term":"Diagnostic Techniques and Procedures"},{"id":"D003933","term":"Diagnosis"},{"id":"D061725","term":"Accelerometry"},{"id":"D008919","term":"Investigative Techniques"}]}},"hasResults":false},

Establishment of a baseline profile of the participants CH attacks (severity, duration, medicine utilization etc), health-related quality of life (QoL) and symptoms of anxiety and depression. No active treatment. Follow-up visit after 30 days.\n\nMonths 2-4: TENS period. All participants will receive TENS-treatment. Clinical follow-up visit by the end of month four.\n\nMonths 5-7: Double-blinded, randomized experimental period.

A microcatheter will be advanced via the radial (preferably) or the femoral artery (in case the radial approach is not feasible) using fluoroscopic guidance and standard interventional techniques, into the distal internal maxillary artery. This artery is a branch of the external carotid artery and supplies the territory of the sphenopalatine ganglion. The microcatheter will be advanced to the ostium of the distal small branches that supply the SPG (i.e. small arteries feeding the vasa nervosum). Once the microcatheter is in a good position, 15 mg Dexamethasone Sodium Phosphate and 15 mg of Ketorolac Tromethamine will be infused over 30 minutes.\n\nThe procedure will be performed with local anesthetic at the arterial puncture site. Conscious sedation will be used for anxious participants. After the procedure, the participant will be observed for 5 hours in ICU setting and then discharged to home.\n\nThe procedure will be performed unilaterally for participants with cluster headache and trigeminal neuralgia.

Migraine has a wide socioeconomic impact and brings a large economic burden; estimates suggest that disability due to migraine costs \\> €27 billion per annum across Europe. Despite its prevalence and impact, migraine pathophysiology is poorly understood. A wider understanding of the functional changes in this disorder would be beneficial to both diagnosis and treatment.\n\nSaccades are the rapid eye movements we make when moving the eyes to a new object in our visual field. Reaction time studies have been used to investigate Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease with great success. These use saccadic tasks (monitoring eye movements). Even at rest we make approximately three saccades per second, so a lot of data can quickly be gathered with non-invasive testing. We hope to understand more of the underlying mechanisms of migraine by studying reaction time in migraine patients.\n\nOur previous pilot study, with less stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria, looked at fewer patients (32 migraineurs and 32 controls), and found that migraineurs showed significantly different saccadic patterns to non-migraineurs.\n\nThis study firstly seeks to corroborate the saccadometric findings of our earlier pilot study in a group of migraineurs, and secondly to explore the specificity of these findings in migraine by also studying patients with another primary headache syndrome, namely cluster headache.\n\nMigraine is known to be a dynamic disorder, with previous studies showing longitudinal changes in the migraine brain. To explore this further we hope to record longitudinally (Every day for 21 days) in a small subset of migraineurs to identify potential longitudinal changes in saccadic reaction time. Because of the portability of the equipment this could be done in the subjects own home if they preferred.","detailedDescription":"As above"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Migraine","Cluster Headache","Control","Menstrual Migraine"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":42,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Episodic Migraine."},{"label":"menstrual migraine"},{"label":"Cluster Headache patients"},{"label":"control (non-headache group)"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"To see if Saccadometry results differ between controls and migraine subjects","timeFrame":"By May 2019"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.

In episodic cluster headache, attacks occur in 'bouts' (clusters) lasting weeks to months. Management of cluster headache entails a combination of attack and prophylactic treatment. Current first choice prophylactic treatment (verapamil) has considerable side effects which can be serious and include possibly fatal cardiac arrhythmias; and it can take weeks to titrate to an effective dose. Evidence has emerged that local steroid injection of the greater occipital nerve (GON) may be effective in cluster headache, but this method has not been investigated as a first line prophylactic treatment in a large, well-documented group of episodic cluster headache patients who are still free of prophylactic medication and just entered a new cluster headache episode. As such, GON-injection has not yet found its way into current treatment protocols. The investigators plan to perform this multicentre double-blind randomized controlled trial to investigate whether GON-injection is efficacious as a first-line prophylactic treatment, aiming to remove the need for high doses of daily medication - such as verapamil - with associated side effects."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cluster Headache, Episodic","Greater Occipital Nerve Injection"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":70,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Injection of NaCl","interventionNames":["Other: Placebo"]},{"label":"Verum","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Methylprednisolone"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Methylprednisolone","description":"Single GON injection with methylprednisolone","armGroupLabels":["Verum"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Placebo","description":"Single GON-injection with NaCl","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Verapamil mean total dose","description":"Difference in mean total dose of verapamil used during the study period","timeFrame":"12 week period"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Days to remission","description":"Median number of days to remission (7 consecutive days without attack)","timeFrame":"12 weeks"},{"measure":"Daily attacks","description":"Mean number of attacks per day during the study period","timeFrame":"12 weeks"},{"measure":"Peak dose verapamil","description":"Peak dose verapamil","timeFrame":"12 weeks"},{"measure":"Preamature termination","description":"Premature termination of study due to need for escape medication","timeFrame":"12 weeks"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Use of attack medication","description":"The total use of attack medication (stratified for oxygen and sumatriptan)","timeFrame":"12 weeks"},{"measure":"Daily attack severity and duration","description":"Mean number, severity (1-10) and duration of attack per day.","timeFrame":"For the total study period and each of the three consecutive 4-week time periods"},{"measure":"Attack-freedom","description":"Percentage of patients that are attack-free at days 7, 14 and 28","timeFrame":"days 7, 14 and 28"},{"measure":"Non-cluster headache","description":"Occurrence of 'non-cluster' headache (number of days and mean intensity per affected day)","timeFrame":"12 weeks"},{"measure":"Adverse events","description":"Percentage of subjects with adverse-events (stratified for type of side effect (AE, SAE, SUSAR))","timeFrame":"12 weeks"},{"measure":"Subjective feeling","description":"Subjective feeling at days 7, 14 and 28 (visual analogue scale, VAS.

Research contents:\n\n   In the Chinese Headache and Vertigo Registration Study, patients aged 4-99 years with headache (primary headache and secondary headache such as migraine and tension type headache), vertigo (vertigo diseases such as vestibular migraine) and chronic pain (fibromyalgia and other diseases) were collected. The biomarkers, imaging features, right-to-left shunt of the heart (lung), genetic characteristics, treatment, and outcome (in relation to other diseases) of headache-related diseases were studied, and long-term follow-up was planned.\n2. Research target:\n\n   We study biomarkers, imaging features, right-to-left shunt of heart (lung), genetic features, real-world treatment studies, and outcomes (in relation to other diseases) for headache and vertigo related diseases.\n3. In order to ensure the quality of the trial, the sponsor and the researcher shall discuss and formulate the clinical research plan before the trial officially begins. GCP training was given to the relevant researchers who participated in the experiment. The research center must manage experimental drugs in accordance with (SOP), including receipt, storage, distribution and recycling. In accordance with the GCP guidelines, necessary steps should be taken during the design and implementation phase of the study to ensure that the data collected are accurate, consistent, complete and credible. All observed results and abnormal findings in clinical trials should be verified and recorded in time to ensure the reliability of the data. The instruments, equipment, reagents and standards used in various examination items in clinical trials should have strict quality standards and ensure that they work under normal conditions. The researcher inputs the information required by the program into the eCRF, and the inspector verifies whether the filling is complete and accurate, and instructs the staff of the research center to make necessary corrections and supplements. The drug regulatory department, the institutional review committee (IRB)\n\n   / independent ethics committee (IEC), sponsor inspectors and / or inspectors may conduct systematic inspections of clinical trial-related activities and documents to evaluate whether trials are conducted in accordance with the requirements of the study program, SOP and relevant regulations (e.g. GCP, GMP), and whether trial data are recorded in a timely, true, accurate and complete manner. The inspection should be carried out by personnel who are not directly involved in the clinical trial. In order to meet the audit and / or inspection requirements of the regulator\n\n   , the researcher / institution must agree to keep the relevant records, including the identification numbers of all subjects (sufficient information is linked to the records, such as eCRF and hospital records), all originally signed informed consent forms. All eCRF copies, safety report forms, original records, treatment details, related communication documents (such as letters, meeting minutes, phone reports). Researchers / institutions are required to keep records in accordance with relevant specifications.\n\n   Relevant Chinese regulations and research institutions' requirements for the protection of subjects' personal information. Authorized representatives and regulatory agencies to examine (and copy if permitted by law) clinical records for quality review, inspection, and evaluation of safety, research progress and data validity. Raw data is all the information necessary to reconstruct and evaluate clinical research and is the original record of clinical findings, observations or other activities. Examples of these original documents and data records include, but are not limited to: hospital records, laboratory records, memos, subject diary cards, pharmacy dispensing records, audio recordings of consultation meetings, automated instrument records, verified as accurate and complete copies or transcripts, microfilm, photographic negatives, microfilms or disks, x-rays and stored in pharmacies participating in the study, documents and records of subjects in laboratories and medical technology departments.\n4.

It is among the causes of the highest morbidity worldwide. Migraine has considerable economic and social impact ; affects the quality of life of patients and disrupts work life, social activities and family life. To decrease the frequency and severity of migraine attacks may be the first goal than treating the attacks.\n\nThe study was designed as a Parallel Group, Add on, Randomized Controlled Experiment in order to observe the effects of breathing techniques on migraine-like headaches, frequency and severity.\n\nMethods:\n\nParticipants will be divided into 2 parallel arms, intervention and control (treatment as usual). Cluster randomization will be performed to prevent intergroup contamination. Breathing techniques will be taught to the intervention group by the researcher. Both groups will continue to use pharmacotherapy for migraine. Both groups will be evaluated with migraine disability level (MIDAS) at the beginning and end of the study. The primary output of the study is to evaluate the effect of breathing techniques on the frequency and severity of attacks in migraine-like headaches. The secondary output is to evaluate the effect of breathing techniques on the MIDAS level.\n\nDiscussion:\n\nThe results of the study will provide information about the effect of breathing techniques on migraine-like headaches. The results of this study will contribute to the literature, since migraine is among the chronic diseases and pharmacotherapy options are limited."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Migraine Headaches","Breathing Techniques"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":86,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"breathing techniques","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The patients in the intervention group will be taught and practiced breathing technique.

Greater occipital nerve (GON) block with local anesthetic and steroid has been described for the management of primary headache refractory to conventional treatment. Two ultrasound (US)-guided techniques for greater occipital nerve (GON) block have been described for the management of refractory headache syndromes: a proximal technique performed at the level of the second cervical vertebra and a distal technique performed at the level of the superior nuchal line. Our airm is to compare the accuracy, efficacy and safety of these two techniques in patients with refractory headaches.","detailedDescription":"We conducted a double-blinded, randomized control trial to compare accuracy, efficacy and safety of these two techniques in patients with refractory headache syndromes. Following REB approval, 40 patients with moderate or severe refractory headaches (intensity score\\>4/10) will be randomized to the \"proximal\" or \"distal\" groups with a 1:1 allocation.

All four treatment methods will be applied to all patients included in the study. One of the four treatments will be randomly applied at each separate ED admission with a gap of 1 week or more in between. This randomization will be performed by a computer at the time of admission. A study nurse will administer the patient's therapy according to the computer's current decision for 15 minutes. Patients and treating physicians will be blinded to the selected therapy. After 15 minutes of the end of treatment (at the 30th minute of the start of treatment), the treating physician will ask patients if they need rescue analgesia and analgesia will be administered if necessary.

Use of capsaicin (active ingredient in hot chili peppers) to trigger release of calcitonin gene related peptide - the hypothesis is that this will be different in headache subjects compared to controls (and if so might be used to predict how these patients will respond to certain medications that modulate calcitonin gene-related peptide). Subjects will be given capsaicin as a cream applied to the forehead or the inner nostril, or a hot sauce that is ingested.\n2. Use of capsaicin to trigger eye watering - the hypothesis is that oxygen gas will slow down the amount of eye watering. Cluster headache patients respond very powerfully to oxygen gas but to very little else. The mechanism for oxygen is unknown but in rodents there is data that it works on the parasympathetic / lacrimal gland system. This study translates rodent data into humans in a non-invasive way to confirm the mechanism of this very effective treatment.\n3. Use of ice water to trigger headaches - brain freeze causes a very short-lived but intense headache that may cause similar biomarker release as other headache disorders. This may be a useful human model for other headache disorders."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Migraine","Cluster Headache","Trigeminal Autonomic Cephalgia","Hemicrania Continua","Paroxysmal

Recently, the term Nociplastic Pain (NP) has been introduced as a third descriptor of mechanisms related to CP. NP describes conditions that arise from altered nociception despite no clear evidence of actual or threatened tissue damage. It represents a new way of describing somatoform painful conditions, originating from altered central-nervous pathways (e.g., central sensitization) and with the important involvement of clinical psychological factors. Among nociplastic chronic syndromes have been included fibromyalgia (FM), chronic migraine (CM) and vulvodynia (VU). These chronic pain disorders have been usually studied separately, although the high comorbidity rates. Many studies evidenced the role of psychosocial variables in the onset and maintenance of the burden related to these conditions. Among them, personality traits, defense mechanisms, central sensitization, and childhood traumatic experiences may play a pivotal role in the onset of the NP. The first aim of this study is to highlight possible psychosocial clusters of variables that are specific for each condition (FM, CM, and VU). A second aim, to improve the tailored psychological treatment devoted to these conditions, is to explore the association between FM, CM, and VU with depression, anxiety, somatization, quality of life, alexithymia, social support, sexual satisfaction, and functioning. This will make it possible to identify specifically for each condition the areas of greatest interest that can be investigated and treated in clinical intervention. To identify specific descriptors, NP conditions will be compared with a control group of subjects reporting other types of CP (e.g., knee arthrosis, rheumatoid arthritis). The study involves the collection of data from a self-administered questionnaire in several Italian centers specializing in the above-mentioned clinical conditions under the guidance of the research team of the Department of Dynamic and Clinical Psychology and Health Studies, PI Professor Federica Galli.","detailedDescription":"Chronic pain (CP), defined as pain lasting more than 3 months, is a substantial healthcare challenge. Prevalence rates of CP are between 11% and 40% (Dahlhamer et al., 2018; Fayaz et al., 2016). CP prevalence increases with age, is greater among females, and among people with lower socioeconomic status (Tsang et al., 2008; Pergolizzi et al., 2013). CP affects relationships and self-esteem, and is associated with higher divorce and suicide rates, and an increased risk of substance abuse (Tang et al., 2016; Fitzcharles et al., 2021), psychopathology (Katz et al., 2015) and risk of medication overuse (Westergaard et al., 2015). The causes of CP are still poorly understood. Recently, the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP, 2017) has proposed that three subtypes of CP may be differentiated based on unique causal mechanisms: nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic.\n\nNociplastic Pain (NP) is a new descriptor of CP and includes conditions that arise from altered nociception despite no clear evidence of actual or threatened tissue damage. NP should be viewed as an overarching term that can be applied to a diverse range of clinical conditions that share common neurophysiological mechanisms, involving various organ systems (Galli, 2023). Among nociplastic chronic syndromes have been included chronic migraine, fibromyalgia, and vulvodynia (Bergeron et al., 2020; Fitzcharles et al., 2021). NP is usually accompanied by other central nervous system-associated symptoms with a close link with clinical psychological factors: general symptoms (e.g., fatigue and cognitive problems), temperamental characteristics (e.g., hypersensitivity to environmental stimuli) and psychological symptoms (e.g., anxiety/depression) (Fitzcharles et al., 2021). Many emotional states, such as depression and anxiety, and emotional processes, such as emotional awareness and regulation, may influence the presence and severity of NP (Aaron et al., 2020; Lumley et al., 2021), opening to the importance of a psychological assessment for diagnosis and psychological interventions. The concept of NP opens a new framework for understanding the co-occurrence of different chronic disorders and the role of related psychological factors. Comorbid chronic disorders may be the expression of shared pathophysiological mechanisms, with etiological and psychological features differentiating them by \"pure\" forms of the same disease. The comorbid association of migraine, fibromyalgia, and vulvodynia, and the well-known link with clinical psychological factors (e.g., early traumatic events, anxiety and depression, alexithymia, dissociation, etc.) is quite established (Bergeron et al., 2020; Fitzcharles et al., 2021). However, these chronic pain disorders have been usually studied as separate diseases. On the one hand, this research project wants to observe the common basis of these chronic pain disorders, which can be traced back to central sensitization mechanisms, the influence of early adverse events, and other psychological factors, and on the other hand it wants to observe the psychosocial peculiarities of each assessed condition (fibromyalgia, migraine, and vulvodynia) for tailored treatment purposes.\n\nCHRONIC MIGRAINE (CM) Migraine affects \\~15% of the general population globally and is typically characterized by recurring, often highly disabling attacks of severe headache, nausea, vomiting, super- sensitivity to light and sound, and other variable physical, mental, and psychological signs and symptoms, lasting for 4-72 h (Ferrari et al., 2022). Migraine is listed by The Global Burden of Disease Study as the third most disabling disease worldwide (Vos et al., 2012). Most patients have episodic migraine, although some patients develop CM (the presence of ≥15 headache days per month). The 1- year prevalence of migraine is 8-15% worldwide, but is highly dependent on age, sex, and migraine subtype (Ferrari et al., 2015). Migraine is 40-60% determined by genetic factors and for the remainder by non- genetic risk- modulating and trigger factors. Although a progressive increase of the attack frequency can occur spontaneously, it is often aggravated and/or induced by overuse of acute headache medications and/or caffeine. Risk factors for migraine progression toward CM include high headache frequency, high headache-related disability, obesity, allodynia, anxiety, and depression (Ferrari et al., 2022). Comorbid migraine and anxiety/depression are common in the general population, but the mechanism(s) supporting the comorbidity are still unknown. Overall, there seems to be a bidirectional relationship between migraine and depression, and a shared pathophysiological mechanism has been recently outlined (Karsan \\& Goadsby, 2021). Indeed, in cohort studies, the risk of incident migraine in persons with existing major depression was threefold higher than in persons without depression, and incident major depression in persons with pre- existing migraine was more than fivefold higher than in persons without migraine history (Modgill et al., 2011). Comorbid anxiety/depression increases the risk of migraine chronification (Guidetti et al., 1998; Tietjen et al., 2007). However, there is no evidence that treating depression or anxiety mitigates migraine (Ferrari et al., 2022). Other psychological factors have been linked to migraine over time, as the case of alexithymia (Galli et al., 2017, Bottiroli et al., 2018), traumatic events (Bottiroli et al., 2019; Stensland et al., 2013), early episodes of maltreatment (Tietjen et al., 2016), personality characteristics (Bottiroli et al., 2016; 2021; Galli et al., 2019).\n\nFIBROMYALGIA (FM) FM is a chronic syndrome characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain associated with fatigue, nonrestorative sleep, and cognitive deficits (Wolfe et al., 2016) with high incidence among women (Branco et al., 2010). The prevalence of CP comorbidities among FM patients was also high ranging from 39% to 76% (with headache and irritable bowel syndrome that were the most prevalent). Although a central sensitization phenomenon seems to play a central role in FM (Arnold et al., 2016), the etiopathology of FM remains unknown (Thieme et al., 2017). For these reasons, researchers have proposed a biopsychosocial model of interacting variables that can activate and exacerbate FM symptoms (Sommer et al., 2012). FM patients experience excessive levels of psychological distress: 20-80% experience anxiety and 13-64% experience depression (Galvez-Sánchez et al., 2019). A recent systematic review on comorbidities in FM (Kleykamp et al., 2021) found that the most prevalent comorbidity across all studies reviewed was depression/major depressive disorder with over half of the patients included having this diagnosis in their lifetime. Another interesting personality construct involved in FM is 'distressed' personality (van Middendorp et al., 2016). Moreover, nearly one-third of FM patients had current or lifetime bipolar disorder, panic disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder. Specifically, among environmental factors, stressful life events have been considered (Nakamura et al., 2014). Trauma and major life stress are unlikely to cause FM per se. In genetically susceptible persons, it is likely that early trauma and prolonged stress in adulthood will influence brain modulatory circuitry of both pain and emotions (Crofford, 2007; Schweinhardt et al., 2008) that could explain the increased pain responses and symptoms of patients with FM. Traumatic events have been shown to influence pain severity as well (Bote et al., 2013). Several theoretical models have suggested that some personality characteristics lead to a worse response to stressors and adjustment to diseases in people with CP, such as FM (Naylor et al., 2017; Galvez-Sánchez et al., 2019). A minority of studies have focused on the detection of personality disorders associated with FM (Attademo \\& Bernardini, 2018). In general, previous studies found a high prevalence of avoidance (41.4%), obsessive-compulsive (33.1%) and borderline personality disorder (5.2-27.4%) in FM (Thieme et al., 2004; Uguz et al., 2010; Gumà-Uriel et al., 2016). In recent years, many studies on FM have reported a high prevalence of alexithymia (15-20%) (Di Tella et al., 2017; Marchi et al., 2019; Atzeni et al., 2019).\n\nVULVODYNIA Vulvodynia is a condition that occurs in 8-10% of women of all ages (Arnold et al., 2007; Harlow et al., 2014) and is characterized by localized pain in the vulva, either spontaneous or upon touch, and can occur during sexual and/or non-sexual situations (Bergeron et al., 2020). Vulvodynia has a negative effect on the quality of life of women and their partners and imposes a profound personal and social economic burden. The diagnosis is established through a careful history and pelvic examination, including the cotton swab test, based on persistent vulvar pain lasting more than 3 months without an identifiable cause and with several potential associated factors. These include musculoskeletal and neurological factors, comorbid pain syndromes (such as fibromyalgia, chronic migraine, and irritable bowel syndrome) and psychosocial factors (Reed et al., 2012; Wesselmann et al., 2014; Bergeron et al., 2020). Current literature suggests that the onset and maintenance of vulvodynia likely involves a complex interplay of peripheral and central pain mechanisms, pelvic floor muscle and autonomic dysfunction, anxiety, depression, and adverse childhood events, as well as cognitive-affective, behavioral, and interpersonal factors (Bergeron et al., 2020). Vulvodynia has traditionally been conceptualized in a dualistic manner, arising from either physical factors or psychological and sexual difficulties, although research contrary to this concept and other hypotheses suggest that these two perspectives should be combined. Therefore, future studies should move in this direction, seeking to identify specific pathophysiological mechanisms within the framework of a biopsychosocial model. Indeed, a more recent theorization has focused on an integrated model that considers the interdependence of biopsychosocial factors in vulvodynia and associated disorders, in which medical and psychosocial mechanisms are considered to contribute to the onset, chronicization and exacerbation of pain and associated difficulties (Bergeron et al., 2011). The neurophysiology of vulvodynia is multifaceted. It is characterized by both peripheral and central sensory abnormalities (Wesselmann et al., 2014; Pukall et al., 2016). Furthermore, increased sensitivity to different sensory modalities at extragenital sites has been demonstrated in women with vulvodynia (Giesecke et al., 2004; Foster et al., 2005; Sutton et al., 2015), suggesting central sensitization. This central sensitization could explain the observation of overlapping chronic pain conditions in women with vulvodynia, which need further investigation to be better understood.\n\nPSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS ASSOCIATED TO NP As the investigators have already pointed out separately for the three pathological conditions (chronic migraine, fibromyalgia, and vulvodynia), there is evidence that factors such as personality traits, defense mechanisms, central sensitization, and childhood traumatic experiences may contribute significantly to the genesis of these disorders through a process of central sensitization of pain pathways. Central sensitization (CS) is defined as increased responsiveness of nociceptive neurons in the central nervous system to their normal or subthreshold afferent input according to the IASP - International Association for the Study of Pain (Arendt-Nielsen et al., 2018). A sensitized nervous system has been considered one of the most important mechanisms involved in NP (Cohen, 2022). CS plays a role in fibromyalgia, in which alteration of central nociceptive processing occurs and pain can be worsened by psychological factors (Sluka \\& Clauw, 2016). In migraine, CS may contribute to acute allodynia and headache chronification (De Tommaso \\& Sciruicchio, 2016). Furthermore, in migraine CS may play a role in trigeminal nerve activation and cortical spreading depression (De Tommaso \\& Sciruicchio, 2016). It has been suggested that migraine may be considered as a brain state of altered excitability and a disorder of sensory processing (Goadsby et al., 2017), encompassing additional symptoms as fatigue and mood disorders (Karsan \\& Goadsby, 2021). Structural and functional MRI studies in women with provoked vulvar or distant/extra- genital pain have supported a role of central sensitization and dysregulation of endogenous pain modulatory systems in the central nervous system in the pathophysiology of vulvodynia (Bergeron et al., 2020).\n\nIn the process of central sensitization, psychological factors such as traumatic events in childhood, the development of specific personality expressions (traits), and the use of different forms of defense mechanisms also play a role. No study to our knowledge has yet tried to identify specific clusters of psychological factors (personality traits, defense mechanisms, central sensitization, and childhood traumatic experiences) capable of characterizing or differentiating between the different pathologies expressed by a NP.\n\nIn addition to this, the study of psychosocial factors associated with the experience of such pathologies or possible emerging clusters such as depression, anxiety, somatization, quality of life, alexithymia, social support, sexual satisfaction, and functioning. This will make it possible to identify specifically for each condition the areas of greatest interest that can be investigated and treated in clinical intervention tailored to the person.\n\nAims To highlight possible psychosocial clusters of variables that are specific to the onset and maintenance for each condition (FM, CM, and VU). Specifically, the observation of possible clusters will be made based on variables such as personality traits, defense mechanisms, central sensitization, and childhood traumatic experiences. The hypothesis is that specific psychological factors (clusters of high number of early traumatic events, high levels of central sensitization, and specific traits and defense mechanisms) characterize FM, CM, and VU groups compared to controls."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Fibromyalgia","Chronic Migraine, Headache","Vulvodynia"],"keywords":["central sensitivity","traumatic childhood experiences","mental pain","environmental sensitivity","defense mechanisms"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1006,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Fibromyalgia - FM","description":"Cohort of women diagnosed with FM recruited consecutively in the clinical department following the criteria:\n\n* age range 18-65 years\n* education \\> 5 years\n* diagnosis of FM according to Wolfe, 2016\n\nExclusion criteria\n\n* severe psychiatric disorders and/or cognitive impairment\n* difficulties in comprehension/expression in Italian\n* history of other chronic pain disorder(s)\n* history of other neurological disorders besides migraine","interventionNames":["Other: Psychological self-reported measures assesment (questionnaire)"]},{"label":"Chronic migraine - CM","description":"Cohort of women diagnosed with CM recruited consecutively in the clinical department following the criteria:\n\n* age range 18-65 years\n* education \\> 5 years\n* diagnosis of CM according to Olesen, 2017\n\nExclusion criteria\n\n* severe psychiatric disorders and/or cognitive impairment\n* difficulties in comprehension/expression in Italian\n* history of other chronic pain disorder(s)\n* history of other neurological disorders besides migraine","interventionNames":["Other: Psychological self-reported measures assesment (questionnaire)"]},{"label":"Vulvodynia - VU","description":"Cohort of women diagnosed with VU recruited consecutively in the clinical department following the criteria:\n\n* age range 18-65 years\n* education \\> 5 years\n* diagnosis of VU according to Bornstein et al., 2016\n\nExclusion criteria\n\n* severe psychiatric disorders and/or cognitive impairment\n* difficulties in comprehension/expression in Italian\n* history of other chronic pain disorder(s)\n* history of other neurological disorders besides migraine","interventionNames":["Other: Psychological self-reported measures assesment (questionnaire)"]},{"label":"Control group (no chronic pain condition)","description":"Cohort of women recruited consecutively from the general population with the following criteria:\n\n* age range 18-65 years\n* education \\> 5 years\n* no previous diagnosis of chronic pain conditions\n\nExclusion criteria\n\n* severe psychiatric disorders and/or cognitive impairment\n* difficulties in comprehension/expression in Italian\n* history of other chronic pain disorder(s)\n* history of other neurological disorders","interventionNames":["Other: Psychological self-reported measures assesment (questionnaire)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Psychological self-reported measures assesment (questionnaire)","description":"The study involves the administration of a protocol of self-report questionnaires consisting of two parts: the main (about 25 minutes for the administration) and the optional one (additional 20 minutes).

We will also compare with healthy volunteers not undergoing surgery.\n\nTo establish whether pain perception alters in patients with chronic migraine/cluster headache having ONS using questionnaires and compare to patients having a general anaesthetic for a non- painful procedure D \\& C at Barts Health NHS Trust.\n\nAre pain markers (Glutamate, TGF-B1) altered with ONS?","detailedDescription":"Headache is one of the most common neurological problems accounting for 4% of primary care consultations and up to 30% of neurology appointments. Even though considerable advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of migraine, new pharmacologic treatments and the emergence of new innovative interventions for difficult cases, in many patients with migraine remain intractable to medical therapy.\n\nThe trigeminocervical complex (TCC) has a crucial role in the pathophysiology of migraines. The TCC is a common convergent pathway by which both trigeminal (dural) and cervical (mainly via the greater occipital nerve) afferent inputs project into higher centres in the thalamus and cortex. This afferent pathway is further influenced by the conditioned pain modulation (CPM) pathway originating from the brainstem structures including periaqueductal grey matter, nucleus raphe magnus, and the rostroventral medulla. There is some evidence to suggest that increased peripheral sensitization of the afferent inputs of the TCC, generalized central sensitization of the trigemino-spinal or the second order trigeminal neurons and impaired descending pain inhibitory pathway, may all contribute to the development of the chronic intractable or treatment resistant primary headache disorder Neurostimulation techniques for treating intractable headache range from invasive deep brain stimulation to less invasive peripheral implantation and stimulation. In 1999 Weiner and Reed described the beneficial effects of subcutaneous Occipital nerve stimulation (ONS) in patients with medically intractable, highly disabling chronic headache disorders Open-label studies have suggested that this treatment modality is effective and safe (Lambru and Matharu 2012). Although the exact mechanism of action is poorly understood, ONS is thought to act by stimulating the distal branches of C1, C2 and C3 in turn influencing the TCC favourably by inhibiting the nociceptive process, resulting in an improvement of symptoms. Previous work has demonstrated a consistent and sustained improvement in conditioned pain modulation (CPM) following ONS as confirmed with quantitative sensory testing (QST) (Wodehouse et al, 2014). QST has the particular advantage of being a functional test that provides a quantitative pain stimulus and assesses the subject's individual response to the stimulus. QST also provides a reliable assessment of changes in pain thresholds and the benefit of ONS. However general anaesthetic has also been demonstrated to cause changes/improvements in pain thresholds, peripheral and central sensitisation and this effect can be long lasting and may account for changes/improvements as measured by QST in subjects having ONS that the anaesthetic provides relief as opposed to the ONS intervention.\n\nQuantitative sensory testing (QST) QST is a term used to describe different forms of psychophysical testing of skin, mucosa, or muscle tissue that assess sensory and pain perception pathways. Nociception inputs can trigger a prolonged but reversible increase in the excitability and synaptic efficacy of neurons in central nociceptive pathways, the phenomenon of central sensitisation in turn manifesting as pain hypersensitivity, particularly dynamic tactile allodynia, and secondary punctate or pressure hyperalgesia and enhanced temporal summation.\n\nQST has been used for measuring thresholds for different sensations in neuropathic pain reflecting the possible nerve fibres that may be implicated in the pathogenesis. Heat sensation threshold reflects the unmyelinated C-fiber function, cold sensation threshold reflects the thinly myelinated A-fiber function and vibration threshold reflects the thickly myelinated AB- fiber function.\n\nQST tests can be classified into the following:\n\nMeasurement of pressure pain thresholds (PPT) (Static measure): This test measures sensitivity of peripheral pain pathways to increasing mechanical pressure. A computer-controlled pressure algometer (available as a bed side instrument) is used to measure PPTs at a standardized point and compared with the affected area. A standardized speed of pressure increase of 0.3kg/s is kept constant during pressure application to the point when perception changes from pressure to pain (pressure pain threshold). This is useful for confirming small fibres neuropathic lesion.\n\nTemperature thresholds: Thermal QST evaluates small nerve fibres, using thresholds for warm, cold, heat-induced pain and cold-induced pain. It involves altering a thermal stimulus until a sensation is perceived. Four sensory sub-modalities will be measured; C fibre mediated warm sensation (WS), A-delta fibre mediated cold sensation (CS), heat induced pain (HP) (mostly C fibre mediated sensation with some involvement of A-delta fibres) and C- and A-delta fibre mediated cold induced pain (CP).\n\nMeasurement of central sensitisation (Dynamic measure):\n\nThis will be done using 2 different techniques as outlined below.\n\n1. Conditional Pain Modulation: Activity within the spinal dorsal horn arising from peripheral nociceptive inputs can be modulated by powerful descending inhibitory and facilitatory mechanisms. An example is provided by the phenomenon of conditioned pain modulation (CPM), also known as diffuse noxious inhibitory control (DNIC) or heterotrophic noxious conditioning stimulation. This refers to an altered response to a painful stimulus following the administration of a second conditioning stimulus.\n\n   CPM provides one of the main supraspinal pain inhibitory pathways and are impaired in neuropathic pain. Diffuse noxious inhibitory controls refers to the observation that the activity of multi-receptive neurons of the spinal cord can be strongly suppressed by an intensive pain stimulus outside their peripheral receptive field. Induction of CPM can be done by immersion in ice water (so-called cold-pressor test), or hot water on a different/distant body part than the one on which the pain perception testing is being performed. This effect represents a well-established model of endogenous pain modulation.\n2. Measurement of Temporal summation- Repetitive delivery of a painful stimulus leads to an increased perception of pain which can be used as a marker for central sensitization. Seventeen, progressively rigid, monofilament, von Frey fibers (filaments represent stimuli from 0.039 - 4386mN) will be used on a standardised position on the back decided by the physician. A baseline NRS score will be obtained from the patient. The von Frey Fibre will first ascertain the least force that measures a sensation of touch or pain (pressure pain threshold). The exact threshold is found by repetitive testing using the ascending fibre sizes. The repetitive stimulation consists of 10 repetitions of a pressure stimulus applied for 1 second duration for 60 seconds. The magnitude of the stimulus is set at the level of the subjects' pressure pain threshold. Patients rate the pain intensity on a NRS for each pressure stimulus, and then for 15 sec after cessation of 10 stimulations.\n\nClinical Data for QST QST measurements have been used world-wide in the assessment of altered pain experience and have been demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated. There exists published evidence of QST measurements in chronic pain conditions like osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, migraine and other neuropathic pain conditions.\n\nQST measurements have been used worldwide in the assessment of altered pain experience and have been demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated. We do not expect any risks associated with the QST. Any discomfort experienced is transient and patients at all times are in control with the experience and can stop at any-time.\n\nIn addition, there is evidence to suggest that cytokines induce headache and headache pain. Furthermore a higher level of cytokines can stimulate the activation of trigeminal nerves, trigeminal nerve fibre sensitisation, the release vasoactive peptides or other biochemical mediators like nitric oxide, which results in inflammation. Many studies have investigated the role of different cytokines in the pathogenesis of migraine but the results remain controversial. One reason for this may be the differing times of measured cytokines in some cases ictally in others interictally. For this study we propose to takes samples at baseline and at the follow up visits and investigate whether there is any alteration in levels of cytokines with the ONS. We will be focusing on transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-1), which is a multifunctional proinflammatory cytokine involved in the modulation of cell growth, differentiation and repairs following injury and immune modulation. Ishizaki et al., 2005 demonstrated that serum levels of TGF-1 were higher in migraine than in controls. TGF-1 has been described as a platelet-derived cytokine as human platelets contain quantities of dormant TGF-1 and reports have suggested that platelets play an important role in migraine and therefore maybe in involved in headache pathogenesis and development of migraines.\n\nGlutamate is a prominent neurotransmitter and has been implicated in migraine pathogenesis. Migraine pain-relay centers, including the trigeminal ganglion, trigeminal nucleus caudalis, and thalamus, contain glutamate-positive neurons, and glutamate activates the trigeminal nucleus caudalis. Glutamate is implicated in cortical spreading depression, trigeminovascular activation, and central sensitization. Glutamate in blood (plasma) and urine will be measured prior to and after ONS."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Migraines"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","primaryPurpose":"SCREENING","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Quantitative sensory testing","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Procedure: occipital nerve stimulator"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"occipital nerve stimulator","description":"Quantitative sensory testing","armGroupLabels":["Quantitative sensory testing"],"otherNames":["Quantitative sensory testing"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of participants with reversibility of a range of psychological markers of pain processing in patients with chronic migraine/cluster headache before and after ONS.","description":"Change QST","timeFrame":"4 WEEKS"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Percentage of participants with pain markers (glutamate, TGF-B1) altered with ONS","description":"PAIN MARKERS ALTERED","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Number of participants whose functionality and quality of life following ONS - HIT6,","description":"Q of L change with ONS","timeFrame":"4 weeks and 12 months"},{"measure":"The effect on functionality and quality of life following ONS - SF-12v2.","description":"Q of L change with ONS","timeFrame":"4 weeks and 12 months"},{"measure":"The effect on functionality and quality of life following ONS - HAD","description":"Q of L change with ONS","timeFrame":"4 weeks and 12 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion criteria\n\nSubject satisfies standard criteria in the study centre for ONS implantation and the NICE 452 criteria for intractable chronic migraine or cluster headache.\n\nPatients who have given their written informed consent.\n\nPatient is able and willing to comply with study procedures and follow up schedule.\n\nParticipants will need a good understanding of the English Language and hence.

The Patient Power App runs on both web browsers and smartphones with data stored in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud, not on a participant's smartphone or browser. The App has four key design pillars: (1) Patient engagement, community integration and education by incorporating GHLF bloggers and chronic disease news and social media engagement to the app for education, support and research findings to be shared directly and immediately with those living with registry-eligible chronic conditions; (2) Personal longitudinal health and medication tracking by providing participants' access to their actively contributed patient reported outcome (PRO) and other health-related data (e.g. current and past medications). We will use messaging to encourage participants to regularly update their information, including medication information. For example, we may remind participants to contribute their medication information with the following message: \"You don't have any active medications. You can record your medications in Patient Power. By adding your active medications, you will be able to see how your symptoms have changed since starting a new medication. Click here to start entering medications\". (3) Health care decision making by allowing App users to share health tracking reports at their discretion with their providers or caregivers; and (4) Research opportunities by providing a platform where an array of new research opportunities can be browsed by participants to combat chronic diseases. The combination of solid governance structure with well-developed policies and procedures, engaged patient community, collaborative relationships with many research partners and our innovatively convenient and mobile approach to data collection make Patient Power a unique and powerful patient-led initiative in chronic disease research."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Rheumatoid

The investigators hypothesize that pre-encounter invitations to clinicians to commit to the recommendations will decrease ordering of: (1) imaging tests for low back pain, (2) antibiotics for acute sinusitis, and (3) imaging tests for headaches. The study is a mixed-methods, stepped wedge cluster randomized trial in which the intervention will be sequentially introduced to 6 clinics in southeastern Michigan in a randomly assigned order.","detailedDescription":"Clinicians often make decisions about ordering low-value services in the midst of clinical encounters when their thinking can be rushed and susceptible to patient demands. This pragmatic trial examines the uptake and effects of shifting clinicians' decisions about ordering low-value services to the pre-encounter period when their thinking is slower and more deliberative; inviting clinicians to commit to avoid ordering those services during patient encounters; and providing to clinicians who committed decision support resources such as point-of-care reminders, patient education handouts, and access to brief communications training.\n\nThe investigators will conduct a mixed-methods, stepped wedge cluster randomized trial in 6 IHA primary care clinics in southeastern Michigan. The intervention will be introduced in each clinic in sequence approximately one month apart and in a randomly assigned order (i.e., temporal randomization). In each clinic the intervention will continue for 1 to 6 months so that the intervention ends in all clinics at the same time. For example, in the first clinic the intervention will run for 6 months; in the sixth clinic the intervention will run for 1 month. The total length of the control period plus the intervention period will be 8 months at all clinics.\n\nPrior to the start of the study, IHA made its primary care clinicians aware of publicly available recommendations from the ABIM Foundation's Choosing Wisely® campaign applicable to avoiding overuse of low-value services for 3 common conditions: (1) low back pain, (2) acute sinusitis, and (3) headaches. However, research has shown that clinician behavior seldom changes as a result of information alone. Therefore, at the start of the intervention period clinicians will be invited to make a pre-encounter commitment to follow the 3 Choosing Wisely recommendations. Clinicians who choose to commit will throughout the intervention period receive point-of-care commitment reminders, Choosing Wisely patient education handouts, and weekly emails with decision support resources. Clinicians will remain free to order services at any time without penalty.\n\nThe investigators will measure whether the clinician-focused intervention leads to declines in rates of ordering imaging tests for low back pain, antibiotics for acute sinusitis, and imaging tests for headaches. The study team will analyze ordering patterns and costs using clinical operations datasets (drawn from electronic health records and from the billing and practice management system). The following hypotheses will be tested:\n\nHypothesis 1: Inviting primary care clinicians to commit to avoid ordering imaging for low back pain, antibiotics for acute sinusitis, and imaging for headaches will decrease ordering of these services.\n\nHypothesis 2: Inviting primary care clinicians to commit to avoid ordering imaging for low back pain, antibiotics for acute sinusitis, and imaging for headaches will reduce health care costs in patient visits for low back pain, acute sinusitis, and headaches.\n\nHypothesis 3: Inviting primary care clinicians to commit to avoid ordering low-value services will reduce per-clinician per-visit health care costs across clinical conditions.\n\nFor each outcome investigators will also compare differences between clinicians who did and did not commit to follow the 3 Choosing Wisely recommendations. Additionally, investigators will compare differences in outcomes between the 3-month follow-up period (immediately after the intervention has ended) and the control and intervention periods.\n\nAfter the intervention period, the study team will conduct surveys and semi-structured interviews with study clinicians. The survey results will be used to identify correlates of primary care clinician uptake of invitations to commit to avoid ordering low-value services. The semi-structured interviews will elicit qualitative data on clinician attitudes towards overuse of low-value services, clinicians' responses to the intervention, and facilitators of and barriers to avoidance of delivering low-value care."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Health Services Misuse","Physician's Practice Patterns","Guideline Adherence","Unnecessary Procedures","Health Care Costs"],"keywords":["Costs and Cost Analysis","Professional Practice","Attitude of Health Personnel","Health Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practice","Decision Making","Practice Guidelines as Topic","Physician-Patient Relations","Physician's Role","Health Care","Quality of Health Care","Quality Assurance","Physicians, Primary Care","Evidence-Based Medicine","Evidence-Based Practice","Decision Support Systems, Clinical","Reminder Systems","Judgment","Cognition","Patient Care","Health Services Misuse","Unnecessary Procedures","Prescribing Patterns, Physician","Inappropriate Prescribing","Over Prescribing","Low Back Pain","Sinusitis","Infections, Upper Respiratory","Generalized Headache","Imaging, Diagnostic","Antibiotics","Humans","Overuse of Low-Value Services","Pragmatic Trial","Stepped Wedge Design","Cluster Randomized Trial","Choosing Wisely"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":45,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Commitment invitation at time 1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Intervention: Behavioral: Commitment Invitation\n\nIn the stepped wedge cluster randomized design, the first clinic will remain in the control period (no intervention) for 2 months and then cross over to the intervention period for 6 months.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Commitment invitation"]},{"label":"Commitment invitation at time 2","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Intervention: Behavioral: Commitment Invitation\n\nIn the stepped wedge cluster randomized design, the second clinic will remain in the control period (no intervention) for 3 months and then cross over to the intervention period for 5 months.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Commitment invitation"]},{"label":"Commitment invitation at time 3","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Intervention: Behavioral: Commitment Invitation\n\nIn the stepped wedge cluster randomized design, the third clinic will remain in the control period (no intervention) for 4 months and then cross over to the intervention period for 4 months.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Commitment invitation"]},{"label":"Commitment invitation at time 4","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Intervention: Behavioral: Commitment Invitation\n\nIn the stepped wedge cluster randomized design, the fourth clinic will remain in the control period (no intervention) for 5 months and then cross over to the intervention period for 3 months.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Commitment invitation"]},{"label":"Commitment invitation at time 5","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Intervention: Behavioral: Commitment Invitation\n\nIn the stepped wedge cluster randomized design, the fifth clinic will remain in the control period (no intervention) for 6 months and then cross over to the intervention period for 2 months.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Commitment invitation"]},{"label":"Commitment invitation at time 6","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Intervention: Behavioral: Commitment Invitation\n\nIn the stepped wedge cluster randomized design, the sixth clinic will remain in the control period (no intervention) for 7 months and then cross over to the intervention period for 1 month.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Commitment invitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Commitment invitation","description":"Clinicians will be invited to commit to follow 3 Choosing Wisely recommendations.

While several studies on MBIs have been carried out to assess metabolomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic, or physiological outcomes, comprehensive studies including all of these components have not been reported. In addition, most studies have been small, comprised of less than 100 research subjects.\n\nOne particular area of meditation research that remains largely unexplored is the gut. A bi-directional communication occurs between the gut and the brain, thus, the gut microbiota can influence behavior, resulting in psychosocial stress and negatively impacting the microbiome. One would predict, then, that meditation-based reductions in stress would have positive effects on gut microbial makeup. Importantly, diseased states are characterized by specific gut microbiome profiles, thus, one can use the microbiome to assay for meditation-induced changes in these states.\n\nIn this study, a comprehensive multi-omic analysis will be carried out to determine the effect of an immersive 7-day meditation experience in a retreat setting in a large 2000+ person cohort. Metagenomic analysis will be performed on the gut microbiome, including healthy and clinical populations, to assess disease-specific improvements (Phase 1). In addition, Garmin wearable technology will be used to collect biometric health data, including heart rate, sleep, stress, and activity, for up to 10 months after the meditation retreat (Phase 1). In Phase 2 of this study, the biological analyses will be expanded to include blood and urine. Taken together, these data will be coupled with self-report surveys of physical and emotional health and integrated into a machine-learning platform to assess microbiome shifts tied with epigenetics, proteomics, metabolomics, transformational language, and improvements in health.\n\nThe advanced week-long meditation retreat will include approximately 25 hours of instruction and 35 hours of meditation. The meditations will include elements of focused attention, non-dual awareness, and loving kindness compassion techniques. While these meditations are unique to this meditation teacher, they are centered around Kundalini and Vipassana techniques. The meditations will be carried out seated, standing, lying down, and walking.
